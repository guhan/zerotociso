# Universal Data Model (UDM)
A Universal Data Model (UDM) is a standardized and extensible data model that represents the structure and content of information in a way that is shareable across different systems and applications. The goal of a Universal Data Model is to provide a common framework for organizing and describing data, making it easier to achieve interoperability and consistency across various domains.

## Common Vocabulary
A UDM defines a common set of terms and concepts that can be used to describe data in a standardized manner. This helps ensure a shared understanding of data semantics across different systems and stakeholders.
## Reusable Components
A UDM often includes reusable data components or entities that can be leveraged across different applications and use cases. These components may represent commonly used business entities, relationships, or attributes.
## Standardized Representations
The data model defines standardized ways to represent and structure information. This includes specifying data types, relationships between entities, and rules for organizing data.
## Interoperability
By adhering to a UDM, systems and applications can achieve a higher degree of interoperability. This means that data can be exchanged and shared more easily between different systems without requiring extensive data mapping and transformation.
## Extensibility
A UDM is typically designed to be extensible, allowing organizations to adapt the model to their specific needs and requirements. This ensures that the data model remains relevant and can evolve over time.
## Industry Standards
Some Universal Data Models are based on or aligned with industry standards and best practices. This can further enhance compatibility and integration with other systems within a specific industry or domain.
## Facilitates Integration
A UDM helps facilitate integration efforts by providing a common framework for data representation. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios where multiple systems need to exchange data seamlessly.
