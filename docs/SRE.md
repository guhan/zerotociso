# Site Reliability Engineering
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a set of practices that focus on building reliable and scalable software systems. To ensure the reliability of services, SRE teams typically track various metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that provide insights into the system's health, performance, and availability. Here are some common SRE metrics and KPIs:

### Service Availability (Uptime)
This measures the percentage of time a service is available and operational. It is typically calculated as the ratio of uptime to the total time (uptime + downtime) in a given period. For mission-critical services, high availability targets are often set to ensure minimal downtime.

### Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)
MTTD measures the time taken to detect incidents or anomalies in the system. A low MTTD indicates that the monitoring and alerting systems are effective in identifying issues promptly.

### Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
MTTR measures the average time taken to resolve incidents or restore service after an issue has been detected. A low MTTR indicates that the team is efficient in addressing and mitigating problems.

### Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
MTBF tracks how reliable your development processes are. 

### Error Rate
This metric tracks the percentage of requests or transactions that result in errors. A high error rate may indicate issues with the application, infrastructure, or external dependencies.

### Request Latency
Measures the time taken to process and respond to requests. High latency may lead to poor user experience and performance issues.

### Request Success Rate
Tracks the percentage of successful requests, indicating the health of the service from a functional perspective.

### Resource Utilization
Monitors the usage of system resources such as CPU, memory, disk space, and network bandwidth. Overutilization may lead to performance degradation or outages.

### Capacity Planning Metrics
SRE teams often track resource usage trends to plan for future capacity requirements and ensure scalability.

### Change Failure Rate
Measures the percentage of changes (deployments, configurations, etc.) that result in incidents or service degradation. A high change failure rate may indicate the need for better testing and deployment practices.

### Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)
MTBF measures the average time between failures in a system. It helps understand the system's reliability and identify areas for improvement.

### SLO (Service Level Objective) Compliance
SLOs define the target performance and reliability levels of a service. Tracking SLO compliance helps ensure that the service meets its agreed-upon objectives.

### Customer Impact Metrics
Monitoring user experience metrics, such as page load times, response times, and error rates from the user's perspective, helps understand how the service impacts customers.

### Incident Frequency
This tracks the number of incidents or outages in a given time frame. It provides an overview of system stability and operational health.
