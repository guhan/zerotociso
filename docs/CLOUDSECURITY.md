# Cloud Security
These are the compliance frameworks related to the cloud. 


# Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) 
CSA has introduced some new star levels to identify the compliance posture of a cloud service. The CSA STAR Certification is based on the Cloud Control Matrix (CCM), a comprehensive framework of cloud security controls.

- Level 1 - Self-Assessment: \
  In Level 1, cloud service providers conduct a self-assessment using the CSA CCM (Cloud Control Matrix) and submit the results to the CSA for publication in the CSA STAR Registry. The self-assessment allows the provider to demonstrate their commitment to transparency and security, providing potential customers with insight into their security practices.
- Level 2 - CSA STAR Certification (Third-Party Attestation): \
  In Level 2, cloud service providers undergo an independent assessment conducted by a qualified third-party auditor. The auditor evaluates the provider's security controls based on the CSA CCM. Upon successful completion of the assessment, the cloud service provider is awarded the CSA STAR Certification Level 2.
- Level 3 - Continuous Monitoring: \
  Level 3 builds upon the Level 2 certification by adding continuous monitoring of the cloud service provider's security controls. This involves ongoing assessments and evaluations to ensure that the security controls remain effective over time. The continuous monitoring helps ensure that the provider maintains a high level of security and responds promptly to any changes or threats.


## CSA CAIQ
CSA also provides a document called the Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ). It is a standardized cloud security posture document that can be provided to parties who want to assess your cloud security posture. It is especially useful for early stage companies who don't have any other compliance standards in place. 

## NIST 800-53
Provides a comprehensive set of security controls and guidelines for securing information systems and organizations

The key areas are: 
- Security Control Families: The controls are organized into families, each addressing a specific security objective. Examples of control families include "Access Control," "Audit and Accountability," "System and Communications Protection," and more.
- Security Control Baselines: NIST 800-53 provides three security control baselines: low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact. These baselines are tailored for different types of information systems based on their risk levels and sensitivity.
- Control Enhancements: Within each control family, there are control enhancements that provide additional measures to increase security capabilities and address specific risks.
- Continuous Monitoring: NIST 800-53 emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring and assessment of security controls to ensure ongoing effectiveness and adaptability to changing threats and risks.
- Mapping to Other Frameworks: NIST 800-53 provides mappings to other security and privacy frameworks, such as ISO/IEC 27001, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and more. This enables organizations to align their security efforts with multiple standards.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
Developed in 2014 it is a voluntary framework that provides a set of guidelines, best practices, and standards that organizations can use to assess and strengthen their cybersecurity posture

The key areas are: 
- Core Functions: The NIST CSF defines five core cybersecurity functions, which represent the high-level goals and activities that organizations should consider to achieve effective cybersecurity risk management. These functions are:
-- a. Identify: Understand and manage cybersecurity risks to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.
-- b. Protect: Implement safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical services and protection of assets.
-- c. Detect: Develop and implement activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
-- d. Respond: Develop and implement activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.
-- e. Recover: Develop and implement activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.
- Categories and Subcategories: Under each core function, the NIST CSF provides categories and subcategories that define specific outcomes and activities related to cybersecurity risk management. These categories and subcategories help organizations understand the areas they need to focus on to achieve their cybersecurity objectives.
- Informative References: The NIST CSF includes a list of informative references to other relevant standards, guidelines, and best practices that can complement and support the implementation of the framework.
