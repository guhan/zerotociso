# Cloud Security
These are the compliance frameworks related to the cloud. 


# Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) 
CSA has introduced some new star levels to identify the compliance posture of a cloud service. The CSA STAR Certification is based on the Cloud Control Matrix (CCM), a comprehensive framework of cloud security controls.

- Level 1 - Self-Assessment: \
  In Level 1, cloud service providers conduct a self-assessment using the CSA CCM (Cloud Control Matrix) and submit the results to the CSA for publication in the CSA STAR Registry. The self-assessment allows the provider to demonstrate their commitment to transparency and security, providing potential customers with insight into their security practices.
- Level 2 - CSA STAR Certification (Third-Party Attestation): \
  In Level 2, cloud service providers undergo an independent assessment conducted by a qualified third-party auditor. The auditor evaluates the provider's security controls based on the CSA CCM. Upon successful completion of the assessment, the cloud service provider is awarded the CSA STAR Certification Level 2.
- Level 3 - Continuous Monitoring: \
  Level 3 builds upon the Level 2 certification by adding continuous monitoring of the cloud service provider's security controls. This involves ongoing assessments and evaluations to ensure that the security controls remain effective over time. The continuous monitoring helps ensure that the provider maintains a high level of security and responds promptly to any changes or threats.
