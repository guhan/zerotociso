# Random Access Memory (RAM)
Readable and writeable

## Key Concepts
- **Dynamic RAM (DRAM)**: uses capacitors that hold charges (0 or 1) and need to be refreshed periodically and is cheaper
- **Static RAM**: uses flip flops, switches which don't need to be refreshed
- Real:
- **Volatile**: once the power is shutoff the memory loses its data
- Considered to be the _primary_ storage of a computer
