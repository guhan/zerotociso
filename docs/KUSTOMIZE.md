# Kustomize
Kustomize is a tool for customizing Kubernetes manifests. It provides a way to manage and customize Kubernetes resource configurations without directly modifying the original YAML files. Kustomize is part of the Kubernetes project and is designed to simplify the process of managing multiple environment-specific configurations, reducing duplication and making it easier to maintain and deploy applications across different environments.


## Declarative Configuration
Kustomize uses a declarative approach, allowing users to describe the desired state of their Kubernetes resources using a set of configuration files. This aligns with the declarative nature of Kubernetes itself.
## Layered Configurations
Kustomize supports the concept of overlays or layers. This enables users to define a base set of configurations and then layer additional customizations on top of it for different environments or use cases.
## Resource Patching
Kustomize allows users to create patches that modify or override specific fields in Kubernetes resources. This is particularly useful for making environment-specific adjustments without modifying the original resource definitions.
## Variable Substitution
Kustomize supports the use of variables in configuration files. This feature is handy for parameterizing configurations and making them more reusable across different contexts.
## Integration with Git
Kustomize can be used with Git repositories, making it easy to version control and manage configurations as code.
## Plugin System
Kustomize has a plugin system that allows users to extend its functionality. Users can create custom plugins to perform tasks such as fetching external data or transforming configurations.
## Compatibility with Helm Charts
While Kustomize and Helm are separate tools, Kustomize can be used as a complement to Helm. Helm charts can be customized further using Kustomize to meet specific requirements.
