# Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) 
Afederal law in the United States that grants individuals the right to access information held by federal government agencies. Enacted in 1966 and amended several times since then, the FOIA aims to promote transparency and accountability in the government by allowing the public to request and obtain information about its activities, decisions, and operations.

### Key Features and Principles of the Freedom of Information Act:

- Right to Access Information: The FOIA gives any person the right to request access to federal agency records, documents, and information, subject to certain exemptions and limitations.
  - Classified information by US Government is not subject to this law. 
- Disclosure of Information: The default position under the FOIA is to disclose information to the public. Government agencies must release requested records unless they fall under specific exemptions (e.g., national security, privacy, law enforcement, trade secrets).
- Submitting FOIA Requests: Requests for information under the FOIA must be made in writing and specify the records or information being sought. FOIA requests can be submitted to the relevant federal agency responsible for the requested information.
- Timeframes for Response: Federal agencies are required to respond to FOIA requests within specific timeframes. The standard **response time is 20 working days**, with possible extensions under certain circumstances.
- Fees: While some FOIA requests may be processed without charge, agencies can charge fees for search, duplication, and review of records. Certain requesters, such as journalists and educational institutions, may qualify for fee waivers.
- Appeals and Dispute Resolution: If a FOIA request is denied, the requester has the right to appeal the decision within the agency and, if necessary, to seek an independent review from the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) or through legal action in federal court.
- Scope of Coverage: The FOIA applies to federal government agencies, including executive departments, independent agencies, and other entities subject to federal law.
