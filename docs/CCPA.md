- Disclosure and Transparency: Businesses subject to the CCPA must provide clear and transparent information about their data collection and sharing practices. This includes informing consumers about the types of personal information collected, the purposes for which it will be used, and the categories of third parties with whom it will be shared.
- Opt-Out of Sale: Consumers have the right to opt out of the sale of their personal information to third parties. Businesses must provide a conspicuous "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link on their websites.
- Non-Discrimination: The CCPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against consumers who exercise their rights under the law. Businesses cannot deny goods or services, charge different prices, or provide a lower level of service based on a consumer's exercise of their privacy rights.
- Data Breach Notification: The CCPA requires businesses to implement reasonable security practices and procedures to protect personal information and mandates that they notify consumers if a data breach occurs that compromises their personal information.
- Enforcement and Penalties: The California Attorney General has the authority to enforce the CCPA and impose penalties for non-compliance. Consumers also have a private right of action to seek statutory damages if their non-encrypted or non-redacted personal information is subject to a data breach due to a business's failure to maintain reasonable security practices.
