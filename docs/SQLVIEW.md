# SQL View
In SQL, a view is a virtual table that represents the result of a SELECT query. It doesn't store the data itself but rather stores the SQL query used to generate the data. Views are useful for simplifying complex queries, abstracting the complexity of the database structure, and providing a way to present specific subsets of data to users or applications. Views can join and simplify multiple tables into a single virtual table, making it easier to work with the data.

## Virtual Table
A view is not a physical table; it's a saved SQL query. When you query a view, the database engine dynamically generates the result set based on the original query.

## Data Security
Views can be used to restrict access to specific columns or rows of a table. For example, a view might include only certain columns from a table, or it might filter rows based on a specific condition. Users querying the view will not be able to access the underlying tables directly.

## Simplified Queries
Views can simplify complex SQL queries. For instance, if you have a complex join operation or a calculation that is frequently used, you can create a view for it. Then, users or applications can query the view instead of writing out the complicated SQL each time.

## Abstraction of Data
Views provide a level of abstraction. Users can work with the view without needing to understand the complexity of the underlying database schema.

## Dynamic Data
When you query a view, it's always up-to-date because it represents the live data in the underlying tables.

## Creating Views
Creating a view is done with a CREATE VIEW statement in SQL. Here's a simple example:

```
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
For instance, if you have a table called employees and you want to create a view that includes only the names and ages of employees who are older than 30, you can create a view like this:

```
CREATE VIEW senior_employees AS
SELECT name, age
FROM employees
WHERE age > 30;
```
After creating this view, you can query it as if it were a table:

```
SELECT * FROM senior_employees;
```
This would give you a result set with the names and ages of employees older than 30, even though the view doesn't physically store any data.
