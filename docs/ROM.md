# Read Only Memory (ROM)
Factory burned in data and cannot be changed

## Key Concepts
- **Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM)**: user can burn in chip data once
- **Eraseable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM)**: can be erased with UV light within a small window of time
- **Electronically Eraseable Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM)**:
  - (EE) Electronically Eraseable
  - entire chip must be erase
  - used for BIOS
- **Flash Memory**: can be electornically erased and rewritten, can be erased in blocks
- Secondary memory: magnetic, optical, or flash based media
