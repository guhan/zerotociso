# DREAD Framework
DREAD is a risk assessment model used in cybersecurity and software development to evaluate and prioritize potential risks associated with a system, application, or software component. The model helps teams identify and understand the severity of specific risks, allowing them to focus their efforts on addressing the most critical issues.

### "DREAD" is an acronym, with each letter representing a different attribute used to assess risks:

- Damage Potential: This attribute evaluates the potential impact or damage that could result from the exploitation of a vulnerability. It assesses the extent of harm to the organization, data, systems, or users.
- Reproducibility: Reproducibility refers to how easily an attacker can reproduce or exploit a vulnerability. Vulnerabilities that are easily replicable may pose higher risks.
- Exploitability: Exploitability assesses the level of difficulty or skill required for an attacker to exploit the vulnerability successfully. Vulnerabilities with high exploitability are more likely to be targeted.
- Affected Users: This attribute considers the number of users or systems that could be affected by the vulnerability. Risks that impact a large number of users are generally considered more severe.
- Discoverability: Discoverability refers to how easy it is for an attacker to identify the vulnerability. Vulnerabilities that are easy to find may be more likely to be exploited.
