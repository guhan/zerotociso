# Synthetics
In the context of performance monitoring and testing, "synthetics" refer to a type of monitoring or testing that involves creating simulated or synthetic transactions to assess the performance, availability, and functionality of a digital service, website, or application. Synthetic monitoring and testing aim to replicate real user interactions and behaviors, allowing organizations to proactively identify and address potential issues before they impact actual users.

## Simulated Transactions
Synthetic transactions are scripted interactions with a digital service. These interactions can include actions such as loading a web page, submitting a form, clicking links, making API requests, or simulating user journeys through an application.
## Scripting and Automation
To create synthetic transactions, monitoring tools use scripting languages or automation scripts to simulate user actions. These scripts are pre-defined and executed at regular intervals.
## Scheduled Testing
Synthetic tests are often scheduled to run at specific intervals (e.g., every few minutes or hourly) to continuously monitor the service's performance and availability.
## Global Testing Locations
Synthetic monitoring tools typically offer the ability to run tests from multiple geographic locations to assess how the service performs for users in different regions.
## Performance Metrics
Synthetic monitoring collects performance metrics such as page load times, response times, error rates, and other relevant data points. These metrics provide insights into the service's health and performance.
## Alerting and Reporting
When synthetic tests detect performance issues or failures, they trigger alerts to notify administrators or operations teams. Detailed reports and dashboards provide insights into test results and trends over time.

## What are synthetics used for?
- **Performance Testing** It helps assess the performance of a service under different conditions and loads, identifying bottlenecks and areas for optimization.
- **Availability Monitoring** Synthetic tests check the availability of a service, alerting teams when downtime or service disruptions occur.
- **Functional Testing** Synthetics can be used to verify that critical functions and features of an application are working as expected.
- **Load Testing** By simulating high loads and traffic spikes, synthetic tests can assess how well a service handles increased user demand.
- **Benchmarking** Synthetic monitoring can be used to establish performance benchmarks and compare a service's performance to industry standards or competitors.
- **Proactive Issue Detection** It allows organizations to identify and address performance or functionality issues before they impact real users.
