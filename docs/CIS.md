## CIS Controls
The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls, Version 8 -- formerly the SANS Top 20 -- lists technical security and operational controls that can be applied to any environment. 

There are 20 CIS Controls, which are grouped into three categories:
1. Basic CIS Controls (1-6) - These controls are considered fundamental and should be implemented by all organizations to establish a basic level of security.
2. Foundational CIS Controls (7-16) - These controls build upon the basic controls and are designed to provide a more comprehensive approach to cybersecurity.
3. Organizational CIS Controls (17-20) - These controls are focused on managing the cybersecurity program and ensuring that it is integrated into the overall business strategy.

Here is a brief overview of the 20 CIS Controls:
