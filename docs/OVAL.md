# Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL)
OVAL is an international, standardized language used for describing and assessing the security vulnerabilities and configuration issues of computer systems and software applications. It provides a structured way to represent security-related information about vulnerabilities, patches, and other system characteristics. OVAL definitions can be used by security tools and scanners to assess and report on the security posture of systems and to assist in vulnerability management.

Here's how OVAL works:

- Structured Definitions: OVAL defines a set of XML-based schemas that specify how to structure and represent information about vulnerabilities, patches, system configurations, and other security-related entities. These schemas define the elements and attributes that can be used to describe various aspects of a system's security state.
- Vulnerability Definitions: OVAL includes definitions for known vulnerabilities, each containing information about the affected software, the version numbers, and details about the vulnerability itself. These definitions may also include references to official vendor advisories, patches, and other relevant information.
- System Characteristics: OVAL allows for the description of various system characteristics, such as installed software, system configurations, and file attributes. This enables security tools to evaluate a system's current state against known vulnerabilities and best practices.
- Test Mechanisms: OVAL defines specific tests that can be used to assess a system's security state. These tests are written in a standardized way and can be used to check whether a particular vulnerability exists on a system, whether a patch has been applied, or whether a specific configuration is present.
Reporting and Assessment: OVAL-aware security tools and scanners can use the OVAL definitions and tests to assess the security posture of a computer system. They compare the information in the OVAL definitions with the actual characteristics of the target system and generate reports indicating whether vulnerabilities are present, patches are applied, and configurations adhere to best practices.
- Automation: OVAL supports automation by enabling security tools to automatically retrieve the latest vulnerability information, perform assessments across multiple systems, and generate standardized reports. This automation helps organizations streamline their vulnerability management processes and make informed decisions about patching and configuration changes.
