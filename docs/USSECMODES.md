# US Government Security Modes
US Government has approved security modes for systems with classified information. 

## Dedicated
  - Each user must have security clearance for all info
  - Each user must have access approval all info
  - Each user must have a valid need

## System High Mode
  - Each user must have a valid security clearance
  - Each user must have access approval _for all info_ 
  - Must have _need to know not for all_ information

## Compartmented
- Each user must have security clearance for all info
- Each user must have access approval _for just what they need_
- Must have a _need to know for all_ information they have access to


> [!NOTE]
>**Compartmented mode workstations (CMWs)**: users with necessary clearances can process multiple compartments of data at the same time
>  - **Sensitivity label**: what level an object must be protected
>  - **Information label**: prevent data overclassification and add metadata

## Multilevel:
  - Some users do not have valid security for all info
  - each user must have access approval for all information they will access on the system
  - each user must have a _valid need to know_
