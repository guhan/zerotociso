# Risk Management


## Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) Cyber Risk Framework
The FAIR Institute is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to establish and promote risk management best practices so that risk professionals can collaborate better with their business partners.
The FAIR cyber risk framework takes an explicit approach to cyber risk management so that organizations can quantify risk regardless of the cybersecurity framework they use. According to FAIR, an implicit risk management approach starts with a compliance requirement and aligns controls to it, creating a reactive risk posture. Meanwhile, FAIRâ€™s explicit approach creates a cycle of continuous improvement integrating risk targets, controls, and a proactive risk posture.

FAIR creates a risk management system focused on:
- Defining costs: the three elements of which are achievement, maintenance, and acceptable loss exposures
- Building a foundation: the five elements of which are cost-effective risk management, well-informed decisions, effective comparisons, meaningful measurements, and accurate models
- Implementing the program: the three elements of which are the risk that drives loss exposure, risk management decisions, and feedback loop for improvement
