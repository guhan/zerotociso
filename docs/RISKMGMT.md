# Risk Management
_The primary goal of risk management is to reduce risk to an acceptable level._

## Terminology
- Asset: anything that needs to be protected
- Asset Valuation: dollar value assigned to the asset
- Threats: any occurence that may cause an undesirable or unwanted outcome for the organization
- Threat shifting:  is the response of adversaries to perceived safeguards and/or countermeasures (i.e., security controls), in which adversaries change some characteristic of their intent/targeting in order to avoid and/or overcome those safeguards/countermeasures
- Vulnerability: weakness in an asset or safeguard
- Exposure: being succeptible to asset loss because of a threat
- Risk: possibility that that threat will exploit a vulnerability to harm an asset
  ```
  risk = threat * vulnerability
  ```
- Safeguard: a control or countermeasure that removes or reduces a vulnerability
- Attack: exploitation of the vulnerabilty
- Breach: A security mechanism has been bypassed or thwarted
- Quantitative Risk Analysis - assigns real dollar value to losses of assets
- Qualitative Risk Analysis - assigns subjective and intangible value to loss of assetss


## Quantitative Risk Analysis
1. Assign Asset Value (AV)
2. Calculate Exposure Factor (EF) - percentage of loss thatn and org would experience if a specific asset was lost/breached
3. Calculate Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) - Cost associated with a single realized risk against a specific asset, expressed in dollars
   ```
   SLE = Asset Value (AV) * Exposure Factor (EF)
   ```
4. Assess the annualialized rate of occurence (ARO) - expected frequency that a risk will occur
     
5. Derive the annualized loss expectancy (ALE) - possible yearly cost of all instances
   ```
   ALE = Single Loss Expectancy(SLE) * Annualized Rate of Occurrence(ARO)
   ```
6. Perform cost/benefit analysis of countermeasures: Can be found by:
   ```
   ALE before safeguard - ALE after safeguard - annual cost of safeguard
   ```


## Qualitative Risk Analysis
More scenario based than mathematicsl. Refer to NIST 800-30 for reference ratings and levels.

- Interviews

### Delphi technique
A structured method used to gather and synthesize expert opinions on a specific topic or problem. 

The Delphi technique typically involves the following steps:

- **Selection of experts**: A panel of experts is carefully chosen based on their expertise and knowledge of the subject matter.
- **Anonymity**: The experts participate anonymously, which means they don't know the identity of other participants. This is done to avoid potential biases and to promote open and honest responses.
- **Questionnaires**: The process begins with a series of questionnaires or surveys that are sent to the experts. These questionnaires may include open-ended questions, multiple-choice questions, or Likert scale ratings.
- **Feedback and iteration**: The responses from the initial round of questionnaires are compiled, analyzed, and summarized. The results are then shared with the experts in the subsequent round of questionnaires. Participants are encouraged to reconsider their original responses based on the group's feedback.
- **Iterative process**: The process of feedback, analysis, and reiteration continues for multiple rounds until a consensus or convergence of opinions is reached among the experts.
- **Termination criterion**: The Delphi process usually ends when a predefined termination criterion is met. This could be a certain level of consensus among the experts, a specific number of iterations, or a predefined level of agreement on the responses.

## Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) Cyber Risk Framework
The FAIR Institute is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to establish and promote risk management best practices so that risk professionals can collaborate better with their business partners.
The FAIR cyber risk framework takes an explicit approach to cyber risk management so that organizations can quantify risk regardless of the cybersecurity framework they use. According to FAIR, an implicit risk management approach starts with a compliance requirement and aligns controls to it, creating a reactive risk posture. Meanwhile, FAIRâ€™s explicit approach creates a cycle of continuous improvement integrating risk targets, controls, and a proactive risk posture.

FAIR creates a risk management system focused on:
- Defining costs: the three elements of which are achievement, maintenance, and acceptable loss exposures
- Building a foundation: the five elements of which are cost-effective risk management, well-informed decisions, effective comparisons, meaningful measurements, and accurate models
- Implementing the program: the three elements of which are the risk that drives loss exposure, risk management decisions, and feedback loop for improvement

## COSO
COSO stands for the "Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission." It is a joint initiative of five private sector organizations in the United States, established in 1985 to address the increasing concerns about fraudulent financial reporting and corporate misconduct. COSO's primary objective is to provide guidance and frameworks for effective internal controls, risk management, and corporate governance.

The original COSO report, titled "Internal Control - Integrated Framework," was released in 1992 and has since **become widely recognized and adopted as a leading standard for internal control and risk management**. In 2013, COSO updated its framework, now known as the "COSO Internal Control - Integrated Framework 2013." The updated framework incorporates advances in technology, changes in business practices, and developments in risk management and governance.

### The COSO Internal Control Framework consists of five interrelated components:

- Control Environment: The control environment sets the tone of an organization and influences the control consciousness of its employees. It includes factors such as the integrity and ethical values of the organization, the commitment to competence, the board of directors' oversight, and the management's philosophy and operating style.
- Risk Assessment: Risk assessment involves identifying and analyzing risks that may hinder the achievement of the organization's objectives. It includes evaluating the likelihood and potential impact of risks and determining how they should be managed.
- Control Activities: Control activities are the policies, procedures, and practices established by management to mitigate the risks identified during the risk assessment process. These control activities help ensure that the organization's objectives are achieved effectively and efficiently.
- Information and Communication: This component ensures that relevant information is captured, communicated, and used to support the functioning of internal control. It involves both internal and external communication, including the timely communication of relevant information to those who need it.
- Monitoring Activities: Monitoring activities involve ongoing assessment of the internal control system's effectiveness. Regular evaluations help identify deficiencies and facilitate necessary adjustments and improvements.

### The implementation process typically consists of the following steps:

- Understanding the COSO Framework: Start by thoroughly studying the COSO Internal Control Framework, including the key components (Control Environment, Risk Assessment, Control Activities, Information and Communication, and Monitoring Activities) and the principles associated with each component. Gain a clear understanding of how the framework aligns with the organization's objectives and operations.
- Leadership and Commitment: Obtain leadership buy-in and commitment to implementing the COSO framework. **Top management should be actively involved in the process and communicate the importance** of internal controls and risk management throughout the organization.
- Establishing Objectives and Risks: Clearly define the organization's objectives and identify the risks that could hinder the achievement of those objectives. This involves considering both internal and external factors that may impact the organization.
- Risk Assessment: Conduct a comprehensive risk assessment to evaluate the significance of identified risks. Analyze the likelihood and potential impact of risks on the organization's objectives.
- Designing and Implementing Controls: Based on the risk assessment, design and implement appropriate control activities to mitigate the identified risks. **Ensure that controls are practical, effective, and aligned with the organization's operations**.
- Control Environment: Strengthen the control environment by fostering a culture of integrity, ethics, and accountability throughout the organization. Encourage employees to act in line with established policies and procedures.
- Information and Communication: Ensure that relevant information is captured, communicated, and used effectively to support internal control. This involves **establishing clear reporting channels** and mechanisms for sharing information.
- Monitoring Activities: Implement ongoing monitoring activities to assess the effectiveness of internal controls over time. **Regular evaluations and audits are essential** to identify weaknesses and areas for improvement.
- Documentation and Reporting: Document the implementation process, including risk assessments, control activities, monitoring activities, and any corrective actions taken. Develop a comprehensive internal control report or documentation that outlines the organization's efforts to comply with the COSO framework.
- Continuous Improvement: Internal control is an ongoing process. Continuously review and improve the implementation of the COSO framework based on changes in the organization, its objectives, and the business environment.
- Training and Awareness: Provide training and awareness programs to employees and stakeholders to educate them about the importance of internal controls, risk management, and the COSO framework.
- External Audit and Compliance: Engage external auditors and compliance experts to review the organization's internal controls and assess the compliance with the COSO framework. **External validation can provide valuable insights and assurance**.

## Three Lines of Defense
A risk management model used by organizations to establish clear responsibilities and accountabilities for managing risks effectively.

### First Line of Defense (Operational Management):
- The first line of defense consists of the operational management and frontline staff directly involved in executing business processes and activities.
- This includes individuals responsible for day-to-day operations, process owners, and business unit managers.
- The primary role of the first line of defense is to **identify, assess, and manage risks** related to their specific activities.
- They implement control measures and ensure compliance with policies and procedures to prevent and mitigate risks.

## Second Line of Defense (Risk Management and Compliance):
- The second line of defense oversees and supports the first line by providing risk management, compliance, and control expertise.
- This group includes risk management professionals, compliance officers, and internal control teams.
- The second line of defense **sets risk management policies, standards, and procedures that the first line follows**.
- They conduct risk assessments, monitor risk exposures, and validate the effectiveness of control measures implemented by the first line.

## Third Line of Defense (Internal Audit):
- The third line of defense provides independent assurance and evaluation of the organization's risk management practices.
- This group consists of the internal audit function, which operates independently from both the first and second lines of defense.
- Internal auditors **assess the effectiveness of the first and second lines' risk management and control activities**.
- They conduct periodic audits and evaluations to provide senior management and the board of directors with objective insights on the organization's risk management practices and the overall control environment.
