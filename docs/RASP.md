# Runtime Application Self Protection
RASP stands for "Runtime Application Self-Protection." It is a security technology and approach designed to protect applications from security threats and attacks while they are running in a production environment. RASP solutions are typically integrated directly into the application or its runtime environment, allowing them to monitor and defend against attacks in real-time.

Key features and characteristics of RASP include:

- **Real-Time Protection**: RASP solutions actively monitor an application's behavior and execution in real-time while it's running in production. This allows them to detect and respond to security threats as they occur.
- **Integration**: RASP is typically integrated directly into the application stack or runtime environment. This integration allows RASP to gain deep visibility into the application's behavior and protect it from within.
- **Security Monitoring**: RASP solutions analyze and monitor various aspects of an application's runtime behavior, such as incoming requests, data flow, code execution, and interactions with external systems. This monitoring helps identify abnormal or potentially malicious activities.
- **Threat Detection**: RASP can detect a wide range of security threats and vulnerabilities, including but not limited to SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution, and more.
- **Policy Enforcement**: RASP solutions often rely on security policies configured by the application's administrators. These policies define what is considered normal behavior for the application and what should be treated as a security violation. When a policy violation is detected, RASP can take actions to protect the application, such as blocking the malicious request.
- **Low False Positives**: RASP aims to minimize false positives by basing security decisions on the actual behavior of the application. This reduces the risk of blocking legitimate traffic or actions.
- **Immediate Response**: RASP can respond to threats immediately, making it suitable for protecting applications against zero-day vulnerabilities and emerging threats.
- **Self-Defense**: The "Self-Protection" aspect of RASP means that it can actively defend the application by blocking or mitigating attacks. This self-defense capability can help reduce the impact of security incidents.
- **Logging and Reporting**: RASP solutions often provide detailed logging and reporting capabilities, allowing administrators to review security events and incidents for analysis and forensics.
- **Language and Platform Agnostic**: RASP can be applied to a wide range of programming languages and application platforms, making it versatile for securing diverse application landscapes.
