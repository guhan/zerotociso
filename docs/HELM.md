# Helm
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes applications. It simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes by allowing developers and operators to define, package, and share complex Kubernetes applications as easily installable and upgradable packages called Helm charts.

## Chart
A Helm chart is a packaged Kubernetes application that includes pre-configured Kubernetes resources (such as deployments, services, config maps) and the necessary metadata. Charts can be versioned and shared, making it easy to distribute and deploy applications consistently.
## Template Engine
Helm uses a template engine (Go templating) to allow dynamic configuration of Kubernetes manifests within charts. This enables users to customize aspects of the deployment, such as the number of replicas, service names, or environment-specific configurations.
## Release
When a Helm chart is installed on a Kubernetes cluster, it creates an instance of the application called a "release." A release is a specific deployment of a chart, and each release can be versioned and managed independently.
## Repository
Helm charts can be stored in repositories, making it easy to share and distribute charts within an organization or the broader community. Helm repositories can be public or private, and charts can be easily installed from these repositories.
## Values
Helm allows users to provide configuration values during installation or upgrade, enabling customization of the default settings defined in the chart. Values can be specified via YAML files or directly on the command line.
## Dependency Management
Helm supports dependencies, allowing charts to depend on other charts. This simplifies the management of complex applications composed of multiple components.
## Hooks
Helm charts can include hooks that are executed at various points in the lifecycle, such as pre-install, post-install, pre-delete, and post-delete. Hooks enable additional customization or actions to be performed during chart installation or removal.
## Helm CLI
The Helm command-line interface (CLI) provides commands for managing Helm charts, such as installing, upgrading, rolling back, and deleting releases. The Helm CLI simplifies the process of interacting with Kubernetes clusters and deploying applications.
