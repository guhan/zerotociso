# Personnel

_Humans are the weakest element in any security solution_


## Job Descriptions
- Add relevant security considerations to JDs
- Add clear job responsibilites and consider principle of least privilege

## Separation of Duties
Sensitive work is divided among several adminitrators so no one person can undermine the effort

## Job Rotation
- Provides knowledge redundancy
- Helps prevent fraud
- **Make sure to audit responsibilities after rotation**

## Candidate Screeing
- Background Checks
- Reference Checks
- Education Verification
- Security Clearance

## Employment Agreements and Policies
- Employees must sign an employment agreement
- Add an NDA
- Add IP protection
- Non-Complete Agreements (NCAs) are not very enforcible

## Security Training and Education
People have varied exposure to Cybersecurity so they need to be trained at a regular cadence about the current threat landscape. 

Focus on the threats where the employee is the weak link and prioritize them by the frequency of occurence across all businesses. 

Areas to cover: 
- Strong passwords, password managers, MFA
- Phishing
- Endpoint protection, malware
- Web based attacks
- Data Classification, PII, using NDAs

Additional training should happen for the following: 
- How to onboard a new piece of software or SaaS service
- How to onboard a new contractor
- What can be shared outside of the organization


## Onboarding and Offboarding
- Clear process for both
- Terminations need at least one witness, and best to do so midweek.
- Perform an exit interview
- Return of equipment
- Final paycheck with reimbursements
- Disable access
