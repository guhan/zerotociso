# Personnel

_Humans are the weakest element in any security solution_


## Job Descriptions
- Add relevant security considerations to JDs
- Add clear job responsibilites and consider principle of least privilege

## Separation of Duties
Sensitive work is divided among several adminitrators so no one person can undermine the effort

## Job Rotation
- Provides knowledge redundancy
- Helps prevent fraud
- **Make sure to audit responsibilities after rotation**

## Candidate Screeing
- Background Checks
- Reference Checks
- Education Verification
- Security Clearance

## Employment Agreements and Policies
- Employees must sign an employment agreement
- Add an NDA
- Add IP protection
- Non-Complete Agreements (NCAs) are not very enforcible


## Onboarding and Offboarding
- Clear process for both
- Terminations need at least one witness, and best to do so midweek.
- Perform an exit interview
- Return of equipment
- Final paycheck with reimbursements
- Disable access
