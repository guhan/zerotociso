# CAN-SPAM
2004
Regulate commercial email messages and establish guidelines for sending commercial electronic messages, including email marketing.

Key provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act include:

- Prohibition of False and Misleading Header Information: Senders of commercial email must use accurate and non-deceptive subject lines and header information.
- Opt-Out Mechanism: The law requires that commercial email messages include a clear and conspicuous mechanism for recipients to opt out of receiving future emails from the sender. Senders are required to honor opt-out requests promptly.
- Identification of Commercial Messages: Commercial email must be clearly identified as such, and senders must include their physical postal address in the message.
- Prohibition of Harvesting and Scraping: The act prohibits the automated collection of email addresses from websites or other online sources without permission.
- Penalties for Violations: Violations of the CAN-SPAM Act can result in significant penalties, including fines and legal actions by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) or state authorities.
