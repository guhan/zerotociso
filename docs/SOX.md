# Sarbanes Oxley Act (SOX)
2002
Enhance corporate governance, financial transparency, and accountability in public companies to restore investor confidence in the financial markets. 

Key provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act include:

- Auditor Independence: The act established rules to ensure the independence and objectivity of external auditors who assess a company's financial statements. It prohibited auditors from providing certain non-audit services to their audit clients and established requirements for audit committee oversight.
- Internal Controls: Companies are required to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting to ensure the accuracy and reliability of their financial statements. Management must assess and report on the effectiveness of these controls, and auditors must evaluate and report on management's assessment.
- CEO and CFO Certification: CEOs and CFOs of public companies are required to certify the accuracy of their company's financial statements and disclosures and to attest to the effectiveness of internal controls.
- Disclosure Requirements: The act mandates timely and accurate disclosure of material information to investors. It also requires senior executives to promptly report any changes in their ownership of company stock.
- Whistleblower Protection: SOX includes protections for employees who report concerns about potential fraud or wrongdoing within their companies. It prohibits retaliation against whistleblowers who raise such concerns.
- Criminal Penalties: The act established significant criminal penalties for individuals who engage in fraudulent activities, such as securities fraud, document tampering, and obstruction of justice. These penalties include fines and imprisonment.
- Creation of the PCAOB: The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) was established to oversee the auditing profession and set auditing standards for public company audits. The PCAOB inspects and regulates audit firms that audit public companies.
