# Fair Credit Reporting Act
1976

Key provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act include:

- Access to Credit Reports: Consumers have the right to request a free copy of their credit report from each of the major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) once every 12 months. This enables consumers to review their credit information and check for inaccuracies.
- Accuracy of Information: Credit reporting agencies are required to maintain accurate and up-to-date information about consumers' credit histories. Consumers have the right to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information on their credit reports, and credit reporting agencies must investigate and correct any errors.
- Privacy and Consent: The FCRA sets rules for how consumer credit information can be shared and used. In most cases, a consumer's consent is required before their credit report can be accessed by third parties, such as lenders, employers, or landlords.
- Adverse Action Notices: If a consumer is denied credit or experiences other adverse actions based on information in their credit report, the entity taking the action is required to provide the consumer with a notice explaining the decision and indicating the source of the credit report.
- Identity Theft Protection: The FCRA includes provisions to help consumers address issues related to identity theft, such as placing fraud alerts or credit freezes on their credit reports to prevent unauthorized access.
- Investigative Consumer Reports: The FCRA covers not only standard credit reports but also "investigative consumer reports," which are used in decisions like employment, insurance, and housing. Consumers must be notified if such reports are being requested, and they have the right to request additional information.
- Enforcement and Penalties: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) are responsible for enforcing the FCRA. Violations of the FCRA can lead to penalties and legal actions.
