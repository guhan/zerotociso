# MITRE ATT&CK Framework

The MITRE ATT&CK framework (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a comprehensive knowledge base and model that categorizes and describes various adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in cyberattacks
- **Tactic**: A high-level category that represents the adversary's overall objective or goal. Examples of tactics include initial access, execution, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, and exfiltration.


- **Technique**: Specific methods or techniques used by adversaries to achieve their objectives within each tactic. Techniques describe the steps and actions an attacker may employ during an attack. For example, a technique within the initial access tactic could be spear-phishing or exploiting a software vulnerability.


- **Sub-technique**: A more granular variation or refinement of a technique. Sub-techniques represent specific implementation details or variations of techniques. They provide more detailed insight into the specific methods used by adversaries.


- **Mitigation**: Recommended defensive measures, best practices, or countermeasures that organizations can implement to prevent or detect specific techniques or tactics. Mitigations help organizations develop effective security controls and strategies to protect against known attack techniques.
