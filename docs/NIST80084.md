# NIST 800-84 Guide to Test, Training, and Exercise Programs for IT Plans and Capabilities
NIST Special Publication 800-84, titled "Guide to Test, Training, and Exercise Programs for IT Plans and Capabilities," is a document published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States. This publication provides guidance and recommendations for developing and conducting test, training, and exercise (TT&E) programs to enhance the preparedness of an organization's Information Technology (IT) plans and capabilities.

The primary focus of NIST 800-84 is to help organizations, including government agencies and businesses, improve their IT incident response and recovery capabilities through the implementation of structured TT&E programs. These programs are designed to test an organization's IT plans, procedures, and personnel's ability to respond effectively to various types of incidents, including cybersecurity incidents and disasters.

Key components and topics covered in NIST 800-84 include:

- **The importance of TT&E programs**: The document emphasizes the critical role of testing, training, and exercises in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities and weaknesses in an organization's IT plans and capabilities.
- **Planning and design of TT&E programs**: It provides guidance on developing a structured TT&E program, including the creation of realistic scenarios, objectives, and evaluation criteria.
- **Types of TT&E activities**: The document discusses different types of activities, including testing (verification of technical and operational aspects), training (building personnel skills and knowledge), and exercises (simulating real-world incidents).
- **Coordination and participation**: It outlines the importance of involving all relevant stakeholders, including IT staff, incident response teams, and external organizations, in TT&E activities.
- **Reporting and analysis**: NIST 800-84 provides recommendations for documenting the outcomes of TT&E activities and analyzing the results to identify areas for improvement.
- **Continuous improvement**: The document encourages organizations to use the insights gained from TT&E activities to refine and enhance their IT plans and capabilities continually.
