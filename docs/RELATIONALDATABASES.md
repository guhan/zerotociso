# Relational Databases
A relational database is a type of database management system (DBMS) that organizes data into structured tables with rows and columns. It is based on the principles of the relational model, which was introduced by Edgar F. Codd in the early 1970s. Relational databases are widely used for storing, managing, and querying structured data in various applications and industries.

## Tabular Structure
Data in a relational database is organized into tables, also known as relations. Each table consists of rows (tuples) and columns (attributes). Each column represents a specific data attribute, and each row represents a unique data record.
## Schema
Relational databases have a well-defined schema that defines the structure of the tables, including the names of tables, the names and data types of columns, and constraints that enforce data integrity rules (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys).
## Data Integrity
Relational databases enforce data integrity through constraints. Common constraints include primary keys (to enforce uniqueness), foreign keys (to establish relationships between tables), and check constraints (to validate data).
## ACID Transactions
Relational databases support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, which ensure that database operations are atomic (indivisible), maintain data consistency, are isolated from each other, and are durable in the face of system failures.
## SQL (Structured Query Language)
SQL is the standard query language used to interact with relational databases. SQL provides a rich set of commands for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data in the database.
## Joins
Relational databases support table joins, allowing you to combine data from multiple tables in complex queries. Joins are a powerful feature for retrieving related data.
## Normalization
Relational databases encourage data normalization, a process that reduces data redundancy by organizing data efficiently into related tables. This helps maintain data consistency and reduces storage space.
## Indexing
Databases use indexes to improve query performance. Indexes provide fast access to specific rows in a table based on the values in one or more columns.
## Concurrency Control
Relational databases have mechanisms for handling concurrent access to data by multiple users or applications. This ensures that transactions are executed in a controlled and consistent manner.
## Multi-User Support
Relational databases can support multiple concurrent users or applications accessing and modifying data simultaneously.
