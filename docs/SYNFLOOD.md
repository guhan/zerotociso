# TCP SYN Flood 
A TCP SYN flood is a type of network-based denial-of-service (DoS) attack that exploits the three-way handshake process of establishing a TCP connection to overwhelm a target system or network with a flood of TCP connection requests. This type of attack can disrupt the normal functioning of a server or network by consuming its resources, such as CPU and memory, and preventing legitimate connections from being established.

Here's how a TCP SYN flood attack typically works:

- **TCP Three-Way Handshake**: In a normal TCP connection, a client initiates the connection by sending a TCP packet with the SYN (synchronize) flag set to the server. The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledgment) packet, and the client completes the handshake by sending an ACK (acknowledgment) packet back to the server. This establishes a connection.
- **Attack Initiation**: In a TCP SYN flood attack, an attacker sends a large number of TCP SYN packets to the target server without completing the three-way handshake. These SYN packets appear as legitimate connection attempts but are not followed by the ACK packets required to complete the handshake.
- **Resource Exhaustion**: The target server, upon receiving these SYN packets, allocates resources (such as memory and CPU processing) to track these half-open connections. However, because the attacker never sends the final ACK packets to complete the connections, the server's resources become exhausted as it maintains a growing number of pending, incomplete connections.
- **Denial of Service**: As the server's resources become overwhelmed with half-open connections, it eventually reaches a point where it cannot handle any more connection requests from legitimate clients. This results in a denial of service, as legitimate users are unable to establish connections or access services provided by the server.
TCP SYN flood attacks are challenging to defend against because they can appear similar to legitimate connection requests. However, there are several countermeasures that can be employed to mitigate the impact of such attacks, including:

- **Rate Limiting**: Implementing rate-limiting measures to restrict the number of incoming connection requests from a single source IP address within a specified time frame.
- **SYN Cookies**: Using SYN cookies to reduce the impact of resource exhaustion. SYN cookies allow the server to maintain minimal state information until the three-way handshake is completed.
- **Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Employing firewalls and IDS to detect and block malicious traffic patterns associated with SYN flood attacks.
- **Load Balancers**: Distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers behind a load balancer can help distribute the attack traffic and reduce the impact on individual servers.
- **Cloud-Based DDoS Mitigation**: Leveraging cloud-based DDoS protection services that can detect and mitigate SYN flood attacks at a network level.
