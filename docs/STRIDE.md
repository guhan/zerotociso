# STRIDE 
STRIDE is a threat modeling framework used to identify and categorize potential threats in software systems and applications.

- **Spoofing**: This threat category focuses on the ability of an attacker to impersonate or masquerade as a legitimate user, system, or entity. It includes threats such as identity spoofing, IP address spoofing, or application spoofing.


- **Tampering**: Tampering refers to the unauthorized modification or alteration of data, configurations, or code within a system. This category includes threats like unauthorized data modification, code injection, or tampering with cryptographic mechanisms.


- **Repudiation**: Repudiation threats involve an attacker's ability to deny or dispute their actions or transactions within a system. It includes threats such as transaction repudiation, log manipulation, or falsifying evidence.

- **Information Disclosure**: Information disclosure threats focus on the unauthorized exposure or leakage of sensitive data. This category includes threats like data leaks, unauthorized access to sensitive information, or insecure transmission of data.

- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Denial of Service threats involve attempts to disrupt or degrade the availability or performance of a system or service. This can be achieved through actions such as flooding the system with excessive requests, resource exhaustion, or application crashes.


- **Elevation of Privilege**: Elevation of Privilege threats involve an attacker gaining higher levels of access or permissions than intended within a system. It includes threats such as privilege escalation, bypassing access controls, or gaining administrative privileges.
