# RabbitMQ
RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker software that facilitates communication between different applications or components in a distributed system. It implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and provides a way for messages to be routed, stored, and delivered between components in a scalable and reliable manner. Here's how RabbitMQ works


## Message Producer
The process or application that generates a message is called the producer. Producers create messages and send them to RabbitMQ for distribution. Messages can contain data, commands, or events and are typically structured in a specific format, such as JSON.
## RabbitMQ Server (Broker)
RabbitMQ is the central message broker that receives, stores, and routes messages. It consists of several components, including the message broker itself, exchanges, queues, and bindings. The broker is responsible for message routing and delivery.
## Exchanges
Exchanges are message routing components in RabbitMQ. Producers send messages to exchanges, which are responsible for deciding how to route messages to one or more queues. Exchanges use a set of rules, known as routing keys, to determine which queues should receive a particular message. RabbitMQ provides different types of exchanges, including direct, topic, fanout, and headers, each with its own routing behavior.
## Queues
Queues are message buffers where messages are temporarily stored before being consumed by consumers. Consumers subscribe to specific queues to receive and process messages. Messages are placed in queues based on the routing rules defined by the exchanges. Queues ensure that messages are not lost and can be processed by consumers at their own pace.
## Bindings
Bindings are links between exchanges and queues. They define the routing rules that determine how messages are transferred from an exchange to a queue. A binding specifies which exchange to listen to and which queue to route messages to based on the routing key.
## Message Consumers
Consumers are the processes or applications that retrieve messages from queues and process them. Consumers can be distributed across different nodes in a network and can scale to handle large volumes of messages.
## Message Acknowledgment
After a consumer successfully processes a message, it sends an acknowledgment (ack) to RabbitMQ. This acknowledgment informs RabbitMQ that the message has been successfully processed and can be removed from the queue. If a message is not acknowledged, RabbitMQ can requeue it or take other actions, depending on the configuration.

To disable auto acknowledgment and deletion
```
autoAck: false
```
## Message Routing
RabbitMQ's routing mechanisms, in combination with exchanges, determine how messages are delivered to the appropriate queues and, subsequently, to the consumers that have subscribed to those queues.
## Scalability and High Availability
RabbitMQ can be configured for scalability and high availability by deploying multiple RabbitMQ nodes in a cluster. This ensures that the messaging system can handle large workloads and provides fault tolerance.
