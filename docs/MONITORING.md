# Monitoring

## Proactive Monitoring:
- Objective: Identify and address issues before they impact system performance or user experience.
- Approach: Continuous monitoring of key metrics, thresholds, and trends to detect potential problems early.
- Use Cases: Proactive monitoring is used to prevent outages, bottlenecks, and performance degradation.

## Reactive Monitoring:
- Objective: Respond to and resolve issues that have already occurred and impacted system performance.
- Approach: Monitoring is initiated after an issue or alert is raised, and actions are taken to mitigate the problem.
- Use Cases: Reactive monitoring is useful for addressing unplanned outages or unexpected issues.

## Real-Time Monitoring:
- Objective: Capture and analyze data in real-time, providing immediate visibility into system behavior.
- Approach: Continuous data collection and analysis to provide real-time insights and alerts.
- Use Cases: Real-time monitoring is critical for systems that require rapid response to anomalies or security incidents.

## Periodic Monitoring:
- Objective: Regularly assess system health and performance at predetermined intervals.
- Approach: Scheduled monitoring checks or scans performed daily, weekly, monthly, or on other defined schedules.
- Use Cases: Periodic monitoring helps identify trends, assess compliance, and maintain system stability.

## End-User Experience Monitoring (EUEM):
- Objective: Measure and improve the quality of the end-user experience when interacting with applications or services.
- Approach: Monitoring from the perspective of end-users, measuring factors like page load times, transaction success rates, and application responsiveness.
- Use Cases: EUEM is essential for ensuring user satisfaction and identifying issues impacting customers or employees.

## Black-Box and White-Box Monitoring:
- Objective: Gain insights into system behavior from both internal and external perspectives.
- Approach: Black-box monitoring observes system behavior from an external viewpoint (e.g., user interactions), while white-box monitoring involves examining internal metrics, logs, and code.
- Use Cases: Combining both perspectives provides a comprehensive view of system health and performance.

## Alert-Driven Monitoring:
- Objective: Focus monitoring efforts on specific events or alerts generated based on predefined criteria.
- Approach: Configure alerting rules to trigger notifications when conditions meet predefined thresholds or criteria.
- Use Cases: Alert-driven monitoring is used to prioritize attention and resources on critical issues.

## Log and Event Monitoring:
- Objective: Analyze log data and events to detect anomalies, security incidents, and operational issues.
- Approach: Collect and analyze logs, events, and audit trails to gain insights into system behavior and security posture.
- Use Cases: Log and event monitoring is crucial for security information and event management (SIEM), compliance, and troubleshooting.

## Performance Monitoring:
- Objective: Focus on assessing and optimizing system performance, including resource utilization, response times, and throughput.
- Approach: Collect performance metrics, such as CPU, memory, disk, and network usage, and analyze them to ensure efficient resource utilization.
- Use Cases: Performance monitoring is essential for capacity planning and ensuring application responsiveness.

## Security Monitoring:
- Objective: Detect and respond to security threats and vulnerabilities.
- Approach: Monitor network traffic, system logs, and security events to identify suspicious activities, unauthorized access, and security breaches.
- Use Cases: Security monitoring helps protect against cyber threats and ensure compliance with security policies.

## Capacity Planning and Forecasting:
- Objective: Predict future resource needs based on historical usage and growth patterns.
- Approach: Analyze historical performance data to forecast resource requirements and avoid capacity-related issues.
- Use Cases: Capacity planning ensures that infrastructure scales to meet future demands.

## Business Process Monitoring:
- Objective: Monitor key business processes and workflows to ensure they meet performance and efficiency goals.
- Approach: Monitor end-to-end business processes, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and identify bottlenecks or delays.
- Use Cases: Business process monitoring supports process optimization and compliance with service-level agreements (SLAs).
