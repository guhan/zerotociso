# EU-US Safe Harbor Framework (Safe Harbor)
2000
A mechanism that allowed companies to transfer personal data from the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) to the United States while complying with EU data protection laws.

Key features of the Safe Harbor framework included:

- Data Protection Principles: Participating companies had to commit to a set of data protection principles, including notice, choice, access, security, and enforcement. These principles were designed to ensure that personal data transferred to the U.S. received an adequate level of protection.
- Oversight and Enforcement: The framework provided for oversight and enforcement mechanisms, such as dispute resolution procedures and investigations by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
- Annual Self-Certification: Companies had to annually self-certify their adherence to the Safe Harbor principles, indicating their commitment to protect personal data in line with EU standards.
- Recourse Mechanisms: Safe Harbor allowed EU individuals to file complaints if they believed their personal data had been mishandled by a participating company. Independent dispute resolution mechanisms were available to address these complaints.

In October 2015, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) invalidated the Safe Harbor framework in a case known as "Schrems I." The court's decision was based on concerns that the framework did not provide sufficient protection against U.S. government surveillance activities and lacked effective remedies for EU individuals.
