# Cross-Site Tracing (XST) 
Cross-Site Tracing (XST) is a web security vulnerability that can allow an attacker to steal sensitive information from a victim's web browser. While not as well-known as some other web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), XST can pose a threat to web applications that are vulnerable to this attack.

The XST attack occurs when an attacker tricks a user into making a request to a target website while adding malicious scripts or content to the request. The attacker's objective is to include the TRACE HTTP method in the request. The TRACE method is a standard HTTP method used for diagnostic purposes, allowing a client to see how a server processes a request.

## How does an XST attack work?
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL or request that includes the TRACE HTTP method and a payload (e.g., a script or content).
- The attacker tricks the victim into clicking on the malicious link or executing the request in some way.
- The victim's browser sends the request to the target website, including the TRACE method and payload.
- If the target website is vulnerable to XST, it will process the request and include the TRACE payload in the response.
- The response, containing the malicious TRACE payload, is sent back to the victim's browser.
- The victim's browser processes the response, and if the payload is executed, it can steal sensitive information from the user's session, such as session cookies or authentication tokens.

## How do you prevent an XST attack?
- Disable the TRACE method: Many web servers have TRACE enabled by default. Disabling the TRACE method in your web server configuration can prevent XST attacks.
- Input Validation: Implement strict input validation and sanitize user inputs to prevent malicious payloads from being included in requests.
- Security Headers: Use security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks, which can be used in conjunction with XST attacks.
- Security Testing: Regularly test web applications for vulnerabilities, including XST, using security scanning tools and manual testing.
- Educate Users: Educate users about the risks of clicking on untrusted or suspicious links and practicing safe browsing habits.
