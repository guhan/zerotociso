# FIPS 140-2
FIPS 140-2, or Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 140-2, 
is a U.S. government standard that specifies security requirements for cryptographic modules.

FIPS 140-2 is published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States and is widely recognized internationally as a benchmark for cryptographic security. The standard defines four levels of security, with each level corresponding to increasing levels of security requirements and assurances. The levels are:

- Level 1: Basic security requirements. Focuses on the use of approved algorithms and basic physical security mechanisms.
- Level 2: Provides increased levels of tamper-evidence and tamper-detection mechanisms to protect against unauthorized access and physical tampering.
- Level 3: Adds further physical security mechanisms to defend against both tampering and bypassing security mechanisms.
- Level 4: The highest level of security, with stringent requirements for physical security mechanisms and protections against environmental attacks.
