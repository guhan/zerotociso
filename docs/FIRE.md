## Classes
| Class | Type | Suppression Material |
| ----- | ---- |----------------------|
|A|Common Combustibles|Water, Soda acid|
|B|Liquids|C02, halon*, soda acid |
|C|Electrical|C02, halon*|
|D|Metal|Dry Powder|

## Fire Detection Systems
- Fixed Temperature Detection
- Rate of Rise detection
- Flame actuated
- Smoke Actuated

## Water Suppression Systems
- **Wet Pipe**: alwasy full of water
- **Dry Pipe**: has compessed air and pipe fills with air
- **Deluge System**: larger pipes and more water (sprinkler), deluge valve keeps pipes dry
- **Preeaction System**: Fills with water and then when fire hits sprinker activates.


## Gas Discharge System
- Dangerous for humans
- More effective than water dischage
- **Halon**: starves fire of oxygen by disrupting the chemical reaction between oxygen and combustible materials.
