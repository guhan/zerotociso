# Service Provisioning Markup Language (SPML)
SPML stands for "Service Provisioning Markup Language." It is an XML-based standard used for defining and exchanging provisioning requests and responses between identity management systems, such as Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, and target systems that require user accounts, access rights, and related resources.

SPML is designed to facilitate the automation of identity and resource provisioning, de-provisioning, and management processes within an organization. These processes involve creating, modifying, disabling, or deleting user accounts, groups, roles, and associated permissions in various systems and applications. SPML streamlines these operations by providing a standardized way to communicate provisioning and de-provisioning requests.


## XML-Based Format
SPML messages are formatted using XML, which is a widely adopted markup language for representing structured data.

## Request-Response Model
SPML defines a request-response model where a client (usually an identity management system) sends SPML requests to a target system, which processes the request and sends back an SPML response indicating the outcome of the operation.

## Provisioning Operations
SPML supports a range of provisioning operations, including create, read, update, delete, and search operations. These operations can be used to manage user accounts, groups, roles, and access rights.

## Schema Definitions
SPML includes schema definitions that specify the structure and content of SPML requests and responses. These schema definitions help ensure interoperability between different systems that implement SPML.

## Security
SPML can be used with various security mechanisms, including authentication and encryption, to protect the confidentiality and integrity of provisioning requests and responses during transmission.

## Extensibility
SPML is designed to be extensible, allowing organizations to define custom provisioning operations or attributes specific to their needs.

## Integration
SPML is commonly used in conjunction with Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems, Human Resources (HR) systems, and other enterprise applications to automate user provisioning and de-provisioning processes.

## Standardization
SPML is an industry-standard protocol developed by the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS). This standardization ensures that SPML is widely supported by various identity management and target systems.
