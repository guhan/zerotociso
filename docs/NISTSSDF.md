# NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)
The Secure Software Development Framework is a guide for how organization can securely manage their software development. https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/ssdf

### SSDF Practice
- Security reviews: A security review is conducted for all major features on the applications I work on
- Continuous code analysis / testing:  We continuously engage in automated or manual code analysis and testing for all supported re- leases, in order to identify or confirm the presence of previously undetected vulnerabilities
- Early security testing: Security tests are run early in the software development process, either by me or by another team 
- Effectively address threats: My organization has an effective method for addressing security threats
- Integrated with development team: Security roles are integrated into our software development team
- Documents requirements: Our org has processes in place to identify and document all security requirements for the software our organization develops or acquires (including third-party and open source)
- Regularly reviews requirements: Security requirements are reviewed at regular intervals (annually, or sooner if required)
- Metadata Generated:Build metadata (e.g. dependencies, build process, build environment) is either generated by the build service, or by a build-metadata generator that reads the build service
- Integrated with development cycle:At my company, the software-security protocol is seamlessly built into our development process
- Standard process across projects: At my company, we have a standardized process for addressing software security across projects
- Monitor security reports:We have ongoing efforts to monitor information coming from public sources regarding possible vulnerabilities in the software we use and its third-party components
- Have necessary tools: I have access to the necessary tooling to execute security tests
