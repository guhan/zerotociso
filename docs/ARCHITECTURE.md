# Architecture

## Immutable Architecture

A software design approach where once an application or system is deployed, it cannot be modified. Instead of updating the software in place, any **changes are made by creating a new version of the application or system and deploying it alongside** the existing one.

The main benefits of immutable architecture include improved scalability, reliability, and security. By treating infrastructure as disposable, it is easier to automate and scale deployments, reduce downtime, and ensure that systems are always up-to-date and secure.
