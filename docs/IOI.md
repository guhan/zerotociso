# Indicator of Interest (IOI)
Indicator of interest" (IOI) often refers to an expression of potential interest from an investor or buyer in participating in a financial transaction, such as acquiring a stake in a private company. It's essentially a preliminary, non-binding indication that an investor or buyer is interested in exploring a potential deal.

## Expression of Interest
A potential investor or buyer may submit an indicator of interest to express their preliminary interest in a business or investment opportunity. This is not a formal commitment to proceed with the transaction but rather a way to signal interest and initiate discussions.
## Non-Binding Nature
Importantly, an indicator of interest is usually non-binding. It means that the party expressing interest is not legally obligated to move forward with the transaction based on the submitted indication.
## Due Diligence
After receiving indicators of interest, the parties involved may proceed to the due diligence phase. This involves a thorough examination of the financial, operational, and legal aspects of the investment or acquisition to assess its viability and risks.
## Negotiation
If the due diligence process is satisfactory, the parties may enter into negotiations to finalize the terms of the deal. This can include discussions on valuation, structure, and other relevant aspects.
## Binding Agreement
The indicator of interest evolves into a binding agreement, such as a letter of intent (LOI) or a term sheet, which outlines the key terms and conditions of the proposed transaction. This document sets the stage for further legal and contractual negotiations.
