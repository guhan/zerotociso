# Continuous Integration (CI)/ Continous Delivery (CD)

## What are the steps for a CI/CD pipeline? 
- Code Repository:
  - Host your application code in a version control system like Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
- CI/CD Pipeline Setup:
  - Choose a CI/CD platform (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, CircleCI).
- CI/CD Workflow:
  - Configure your CI/CD system to perform the following tasks:
    - Build:
        - Build your application code into deployable artifacts (e.g., Docker images, JAR files).
          - Containerization: If your application is not already containerized, create Docker images for your application components.
        - Store the artifacts in a container registry (e.g., Amazon ECR, Docker Hub).
      - Test:
        - Execute automated tests to validate the application
          - unit tests
          - integration tests
      - Deployment:
        - Define the Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) that describe your application's deployment, services, and other resources.
        - Use Kubernetes configuration files to specify the desired state of your application.

- EKS Access Configuration:
  - Configure authentication and permissions to allow your CI/CD pipeline to interact with your EKS cluster.

- Integration with Kubernetes:
  - Ensure that your CI/CD system can interact with the Kubernetes cluster running in EKS.
  - Set up a Kubernetes context to access your EKS cluster using the kubectl command-line tool or other Kubernetes client libraries.

- Environment Configuration:
  - Use Kubernetes ConfigMaps or Secrets to store configuration settings required for your application.
  - Customize environment-specific configurations for your deployments.

- Deployment Strategy:
  - Define your deployment strategy, which can include rolling updates, blue-green deployments, or canary releases.

- Continuous Deployment:
  - Set up a trigger mechanism in your CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy to EKS whenever changes are pushed to the main branch or feature branches.

- Monitoring and Observability:
  - Implement monitoring and logging solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, AWS CloudWatch) to collect and visualize metrics from your applications running on EKS.
 
- Security and Access Control:
  - Ensure that your CI/CD system and EKS cluster are configured with appropriate security measures, including RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and network policies.
 
- Rollback and Recovery:
  - Implement rollback procedures in case a deployment goes wrong. Make sure you can quickly revert to a previous stable state if necessary.

- Notifications:
  - Configure notifications to alert your team of successful deployments or any issues during the CI/CD process.

- Documentation:
  - Document your CI/CD pipeline setup, including deployment procedures, access controls, and environment configurations.

- Testing in Staging:
  - Before deploying to production, thoroughly test your application in a staging environment that closely resembles your production environment.

- Production Deployment:
  - Deploy to the production environment using your CI/CD pipeline after successful testing and validation in the staging environment.

- Scaling and Optimization:
  - Continuously monitor and optimize your EKS cluster for performance, scalability, and cost-efficiency.

- Versioning and Tagging:
  - Maintain version control of your application and Docker images by tagging releases and maintaining a clear versioning strategy.

- Compliance and Security Scanning:
  - Implement security scanning tools to ensure that your container images are free from vulnerabilities and meet compliance requirements.-
