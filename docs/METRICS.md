# Metrics
Metrics are quantifiable measurements or data points that provide objective information about the performance, status, or characteristics of a system, process, or activity. 

- Metrics are expressed as numerical values, making them objective and measurable.
- Many metrics are time-bound and are measured over a specific time period, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or annually.


## P90 (90th percentile)
This metric signifies that 90% of requests are completed within the given latency value, while the remaining 10% took longer. Monitoring P90 helps you understand the application's performance for most users, optimizing it for the majority of traffic.

## P95 (95th percentile)
P95 latency reveals that 95% of requests fall below the specified threshold. This metric gives you additional insights into user experience, allowing you to cater to a wider audience.

## P99 (99th percentile) 
The P99 metric indicates that 99% of requests are completed within the recorded latency. This value considers the long tail of request times, enabling you to identify problems that only affect a small percentage of users.
