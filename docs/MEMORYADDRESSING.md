# Memory Addressing

## Key Concepts
- **Register addressing**: in CPU
- **Immediate addressing**: a holding spot for current data and then instuctions for next register
- **Direct addressing**: CPU is given actual address of memory location to access, address must be on same memory page
- **Indirect addressing**: the holding spot is a another memory location maybe on a different page
- **Base + Offset addressing**: base value is stored in one the CPU registers and an offset is given for the operand
- **Virtual Memory**: a pagefile that exists on a hard disk
