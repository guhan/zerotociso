# Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)
The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&S)) worked with Department of Defense (DoD) stakeholder, University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to standardize cybersecurity across the Defense Industrial Base (DIB).
Unlike other maturity models, CMMC is both a set of best practices and a requirement for organizations that solicit DoD contracts. CMMC lists five maturity levels, primarily based on whether the data an organization collects, transmits, stores, and processes is Federal Contract Information (FCI) or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

The five certification levels are:
- Level 1: Basic safeguarding of FCI and basic cyber hygiene
- Level 2: Documenting and processes the transition phase to prove intermediate cyber hygiene practices for FCI and CUI
- Level 3: Establishing basic CUI protections, managing processes, and developing good cyber hygiene practices
- Level 4: Increasing security over CUI, reducing advanced persistent threat (APT) risks, reviewing processes, and establishing proactive practices
- Level 5: Furthering risk reduction around APTs, optimizing processes, and establishing advanced/progressive practices

As an organization’s maturity level increases, so do the required controls’ number and sophistication level. At Maturity Level 1, an organization only needs seventeen practices. Meanwhile, an organization that needs to meet Maturity Level 5 compliance needs 173 practices in place.
