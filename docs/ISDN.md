# ISDN
ISDN stands for Integrated Services Digital Network, which is a set of communication standards that were widely used in the late 20th century and early 21st century to transmit voice, data, and other digital services over telephone lines. ISDN was designed to provide a more efficient and reliable way of transmitting digital information compared to traditional analog telephone lines.

## Digital Communication
ISDN uses digital transmission techniques, as opposed to traditional analog phone lines, which are susceptible to interference and signal degradation. Digital transmission allows for higher-quality voice calls and more reliable data transmission.

## B Channels
ISDN divides the communication channel into two separate 64 Kbps (kilobits per second) channels called "B channels." These channels can carry voice, data, or other digital services independently. The two B channels can be combined for a total bandwidth of 128 Kbps.

## D Channel
In addition to the B channels, ISDN includes a 16 Kbps "D channel" (Delta channel) for signaling and control purposes. The D channel is used for call setup, teardown, and other control functions.

## Bearer and Signaling Channels
The B channels are referred to as "bearer channels" because they carry user data, while the D channel is the "signaling channel" responsible for managing call control and other signaling functions.

## Two Types of ISDN
- BRI (Basic Rate Interface): BRI is the basic form of ISDN and typically provides two B channels and one D channel. It is commonly used for small businesses and residential connections.
- PRI (Primary Rate Interface): PRI is a higher-capacity ISDN service typically used by larger organizations. It provides multiple B channels (usually 23 in North America and 30 in Europe) and one or more D channels.

## Voice and Data
ISDN supports both voice and data transmission, making it versatile for various applications. It was used for voice calls, video conferencing, fax, and digital data transfer.

## Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
DSL technology evolved from ISDN and continues to use aspects of ISDN's digital transmission principles. DSL provides high-speed internet access over existing copper phone lines.

## Global Standards
ISDN standards were developed by international telecommunications organizations, ensuring interoperability between different network providers and countries.
