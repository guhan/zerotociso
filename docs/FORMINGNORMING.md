# Stages of Team Behaviour


## Forming
- Testing: Testing the boundaries for acceptable behaviour
- Dependence: Dependence on the leader for guidance on acceptable behaviour

- Things you may observe in the group: 
  - the discussion of irrelevant and partially relevant issues
  - the discussion of peripheral problems
  - the discussion of immediate behavior problems
  - the discussion of symptoms
  - griping about the institutional environment


- As the leader you may directly experience:
  - attempts to establish a proper relationship with you through the development of rapport and confidence
  - flow of information
  - suspicious of and fearfulness toward the new situation which must be overcome
  - antisocial individuals (drug addicts and delinquents) who probably must be won over to the situation and their initial extreme resistance overcome before the normal sequence of therapy-group development can begin

 ## Storming
 - Conflict: typified by defensiveness, competition and jealousy
 - psychodramatic acting-out and localization of conflicts in the group
 - beginning with derogation and negativity
 - a stage of polarization featuring the emergence of sub-groups following a stage of interpersonal exploration

- As a leader you may direclty experience:
  - ambivalence towards you


## Norming
- Cohesion: in-group consciousness is developed and establishment and maintenance of group boundaries is emphasized
- existence of a common goal and group spirit
- Things you may observe in the group:
  - process of common ideation
  - asks for an opinion vs gives an opinion
  - emergence of a team `dialect'

## Performing
- Each member takes on a specific role
- emphasis on task achievement which is superordinate to social structure
- interpersonal bonds are genuine and strong ... members give one another a great deal of mutual evaluative support, which seems to be a prime requisite for successful behavior change.
