# Shibboleth
Shibboleth is an open-source federated identity and single sign-on (SSO) system designed to enable secure and seamless access to web applications and services within organizations and across multiple organizations. It is commonly used in the education and research sector but is also employed in various other sectors, including government, healthcare, and business.

## Federated Identity
Shibboleth enables federated identity management, allowing users to access multiple web applications and services across different organizations using a single set of credentials. This eliminates the need for users to create and manage separate accounts for each service.
## Single Sign-On (SSO)
With Shibboleth, users sign in once (typically using their home organization's identity provider), and they are then granted access to various web applications and services without the need to re-enter their credentials. This provides a more seamless and user-friendly experience.
## Identity Providers (IdPs)
In the Shibboleth architecture, Identity Providers are responsible for authenticating users and providing information about them (attributes) to Service Providers. Each organization typically operates its own IdP.
## Service Providers (SPs)
Service Providers are web applications or services that rely on Shibboleth for authentication and authorization. They request user attributes from the IdP to make access control decisions.
## Attribute Release
Shibboleth allows IdPs to release specific attributes or information about users to SPs based on user consent and privacy policies. This ensures that sensitive user data is only shared with authorized services.
## Security
Shibboleth employs strong security measures, including encrypted communication between IdPs and SPs, to protect user credentials and attribute data during transmission.
## Metadata Exchange
Metadata about IdPs and SPs is exchanged and shared within the Shibboleth federation. This metadata helps service providers and identity providers discover and establish trust with one another.
## Open Source
Shibboleth is open-source software, which means that organizations can freely use, customize, and extend the system to meet their specific needs. It is developed and maintained by the Shibboleth Consortium and the open-source community.
