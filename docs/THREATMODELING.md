# Threat Modeling

### Identify Threats
- Focus on Assets
- Focus on Attackers
- Focus on Software

### Determine and Diagram Potential Attacks
- Create flow diagrams to see how users interact with your application
- Identify attacks on each element of the diagram

### Perform Reduction Analysis
Decompose the application to understand the logic behind how each piece interacts with each other. 

Identify these 5 key concepts: 
- Trust boundaries: where does trust or security change
- Data flow paths: how does data move in the application
- Input points: Where does external input get processed
- Privileged Operations: Where are greater privileges required
- Details about Security Stance and approach: look at the security policies and design documents

### Prioritization and Response
Rank or rate the threats. A common way is:  
```
probability * damage potential Ranking (High/Med/Low)
```





## What is the TRIKE Framework?
TRIKE provides a structured approach to cybersecurity risk assessment and management, helping organizations proactively address potential security threats and vulnerabilities.

### Key Components of TRIKE Methodology:

- Threat Assessment: The first step involves identifying potential threats that could exploit vulnerabilities in an organization's systems or networks. Threat sources, motivations, and capabilities are analyzed to understand the likelihood of specific threats.
- Risk Assessment: TRIKE considers the potential impact of identified threats on the organization's assets and operations. It assesses the likelihood and consequences of successful attacks to prioritize risks and determine where to focus mitigation efforts.
- Vulnerability Assessment: The methodology evaluates the organization's vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be exploited by potential threats. This includes analyzing the security measures in place, such as software flaws, configuration errors, or misconfigurations.
- Countermeasure Selection: After identifying threats, risks, and vulnerabilities, the next step is to select appropriate countermeasures and security controls to mitigate the identified risks effectively.
- Mitigation Planning: TRIKE helps organizations develop a comprehensive mitigation plan that outlines the steps needed to address the identified risks. The plan includes the implementation of security controls, monitoring, incident response, and other measures to enhance cybersecurity resilience.
- Continuous Improvement: TRIKE emphasizes the need for ongoing assessment and adaptation of security measures to address evolving threats and risks. Regular reviews and updates to the risk assessment and mitigation strategies are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.
