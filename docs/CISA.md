# Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA)
2015
Encourage and facilitate the sharing of cybersecurity threat information between the private sector and the government.

Key provisions of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act include:

- Cyber Threat Information Sharing: CISA provides a framework for private sector companies to voluntarily share cybersecurity threat indicators (such as IP addresses, malware samples, and attack signatures) with federal government agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Defense (DoD), and the intelligence community.
- Privacy Protections: The law includes provisions to protect the privacy of personal and sensitive information shared under CISA. It requires that any shared information undergo a review and scrubbing process to remove personal information that is unrelated to a cyber threat.
- Liability Protection: CISA provides liability protection for private sector entities that share cyber threat information with the government, as well as for those that receive and use such information for cybersecurity purposes. This protection is intended to encourage organizations to share information without fear of legal repercussions.
- Use of Shared Information: The law stipulates that the government can only use shared information for cybersecurity purposes, national security, and the protection of human life. It places restrictions on the use of shared information for law enforcement or regulatory actions.
- Real-Time Sharing: CISA encourages real-time sharing of cyber threat indicators, allowing for quicker response and mitigation of cyber threats.
- Federal Agency Coordination: The law requires federal agencies to establish procedures for receiving, disseminating, and using shared cyber threat information.
