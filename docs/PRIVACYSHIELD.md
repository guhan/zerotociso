# Privacy Shield
2015

A framework for data protection and privacy that allowed companies to transfer personal data from the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA) to the United States in compliance with EU data protection laws

Key features of the Privacy Shield included:

- Data Protection Principles: Participating companies were required to adhere to certain data protection principles that aligned with EU data protection standards. These principles covered areas such as notice, choice, accountability, security, and recourse.
- Oversight and Enforcement: The framework included mechanisms for monitoring and enforcement, such as self-certification by U.S. companies and cooperation with EU data protection authorities.
- Redress Mechanisms: Privacy Shield provided EU individuals with several means to address privacy concerns, including the ability to file complaints with participating companies, independent dispute resolution mechanisms, and a designated Privacy Shield Ombudsperson to handle national security-related complaints.
- Annual Review: The framework required an annual review of the Privacy Shield's functioning and effectiveness by the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce.

In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued a ruling known as "Schrems II," which invalidated the Privacy Shield framework.
