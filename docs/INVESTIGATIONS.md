# Investigations

## Types
- **Adminstratrive**: investigate operational issues or violation of organizations polices
- **Criminal**: investigate alleged violation of a criminal law. Evidence must meet the _beyond a
  resasonable doubt_ standard. 
- **Civil**: investigate violation of some policy or agreement and do not involve law enforcement.
  _preponderance of evidence_ standard which is that it must support that the outcome of the case
  is more likely than not.


## Electronic Discovery 
The electronic discovery (eDiscovery) process is a critical part of legal proceedings in which 
electronic information, such as emails, documents, databases, and other digital records, is 
collected, preserved, reviewed, and produced as evidence in legal cases. The eDiscovery process 
can be complex and consists of several stages:

- **Identification**:
The process begins with identifying the potential sources of electronically stored information (ESI) relevant to the legal case.
It involves determining where ESI might reside, including on servers, computers, mobile devices, cloud storage, and email servers.
- **Preservation**:
Once identified, the relevant ESI must be preserved to prevent data loss or tampering. This includes issuing legal holds to ensure data isn't deleted or altered.
Preservation may involve suspending routine data deletion processes and creating backups of critical information.
- **Collection**:
After preservation, ESI is collected from various sources, which can include forensic imaging of hard drives, extracting data from email servers, and copying files from cloud storage.
It's crucial to maintain a chain of custody to ensure the integrity of collected data.
- **Processing**:
Collected ESI is processed to reduce the volume of data for review and analysis. This includes de-duplication (removing duplicate files), keyword filtering, and file format conversion.
Processing tools can generate metadata and index documents to make them searchable.
- **Review**:
Legal professionals review the processed ESI for relevance, privilege, and potential evidence. Reviewers assess whether documents should be produced or withheld based on attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, or relevance to the case.
Reviewers may use eDiscovery software and review platforms to facilitate the review process.
- **Analysis**:
Advanced analytics tools can assist in identifying patterns, trends, and key documents within the ESI.
Concept clustering, predictive coding, and machine learning may be used to expedite review and uncover relevant information.
- **Production**:
Once the relevant ESI has been identified and reviewed, it is produced to opposing parties or submitted to the court as evidence.
Produced data is often exchanged in agreed-upon formats, such as TIFF images, PDFs, or native file formats.
- **Presentation**:
During legal proceedings, the produced ESI may be presented to support arguments, claims, or defenses.
This can involve the use of electronic presentation tools, such as document viewers or courtroom technology.
- **Challenge and Resolution**:
The opposing parties may challenge the produced ESI, particularly if they believe that relevant information was withheld or that the production was incomplete.
Courts may become involved in resolving disputes regarding eDiscovery.
- **Post-Production Activities**:
After production, it's essential to maintain records of what was produced and to securely dispose of any remaining copies of irrelevant data to comply with data privacy regulations.
- **Documentation and Reporting**:
Comprehensive documentation is crucial throughout the eDiscovery process, detailing every step taken and the decisions made.
Reporting may be necessary to demonstrate compliance with eDiscovery rules and court orders.


## Evidence

- **Admissable Evidence**:
  - **Relevant** to determining a fact
  - **Material** or related to the case
  - **Competant** must have been obtained legally
- **Real Evidence**: tangible stuff like objects, computers, DNA
- **Documentary Evidence**: written items
  - _best evidence rule_: original document must be used
  - _parol evidence rule_: when argreement is written, it is assumed to contain all the terms of the
    agreement and no verbal arguments
- **Testimonial Evidence**: testimony of witnesses
