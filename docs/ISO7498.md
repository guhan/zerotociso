# ISO 7498: OSI Reference Model
ISO/IEC 7498 is a standard that defines the basic reference model for Open Systems Interconnection (OSI), commonly known as the OSI model. The OSI model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or networking system into seven distinct layers. Each layer in the OSI model has specific functions and interacts with adjacent layers to enable communication between devices and systems in a network.

## Physical Layer (Layer 1)
The physical layer deals with the physical transmission of data over a medium, such as cables, optical fibers, or wireless signals. It defines the hardware characteristics, such as connectors, voltage levels, and signaling.
## Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
The data link layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of data frames between directly connected nodes. It handles tasks such as framing, error detection and correction, and flow control. Ethernet is an example of a data link layer protocol.
## Network Layer (Layer 3)
The network layer is responsible for routing data between devices across different networks. It determines the best path for data to travel and uses logical addressing (such as IP addresses) to identify devices on different networks. The Internet Protocol (IP) operates at this layer.
## Transport Layer (Layer 4)
The transport layer is responsible for end-to-end communication and ensures that data is delivered reliably and in the correct order. It provides mechanisms for error recovery and flow control. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) operate at this layer.
## Session Layer (Layer 5)
The session layer establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between devices. It manages the dialog between applications and provides services like session checkpointing and recovery.
## Presentation Layer (Layer 6)
The presentation layer is responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression. It ensures that data sent by one system can be understood by another system with different data formats or character sets.
## Application Layer (Layer 7)
The application layer contains the network services that directly support user applications, such as email, web browsing, and file transfer. It provides a user interface for applications to access network services.
