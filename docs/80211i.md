# Wireless Standard 802.11i
802.11i is a security standard for wireless local area networks (WLANs) that is part of the IEEE 802.11 family of wireless networking protocols. It is often referred to as WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2), which is the Wi-Fi Alliance's certification program for products that implement the 802.11i security standard. 802.11i/WPA2 was introduced to address the security weaknesses of its predecessor, WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy), and provide robust security mechanisms for wireless networks.

## Robust Encryption
802.11i/WPA2 uses strong encryption algorithms to protect data transmitted over a wireless network. The primary encryption protocol used is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which is highly secure and widely adopted.
## Authentication
It employs strong mutual authentication methods to ensure that both the client device and the access point (AP) or network are who they claim to be. This prevents unauthorized devices from connecting to the network.
## Key Management
802.11i/WPA2 includes robust key management mechanisms for generating and distributing encryption keys securely. This ensures that encryption keys are regularly refreshed and that they remain confidential.
## Dynamic Keying
It supports the use of dynamic encryption keys, which are generated uniquely for each session or connection. This makes it more challenging for attackers to eavesdrop on communications.
## Support for Enterprise Environments
802.11i/WPA2 includes features designed for enterprise-level deployments, such as the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) framework, which allows for a variety of authentication methods, including username/password, digital certificates, and more.
## Pre-Shared Key (PSK) Mode
While 802.11i/WPA2 is often associated with enterprise-level security, it also includes a PSK mode that is suitable for small-scale deployments, such as home networks. In PSK mode, a pre-shared passphrase is used to authenticate and derive encryption keys.
## Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)
In addition to AES, 802.11i/WPA2 initially introduced TKIP as an interim security measure. TKIP was designed to be more secure than WEP but less secure than AES. It was later deprecated in favor of using AES exclusively.
