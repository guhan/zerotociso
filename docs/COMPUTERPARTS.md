# Computer Parts
Any tangible part of the computer you can reach out and touch 

## Processors
  
 
## Memory



### Memory Addressing
- **Register addressing**: in CPU
- **Immediate addressing**: a holding spot for current data and then instuctions for next register
- **Direct addressing**: CPU is given actual address of memory location to access, address must be on same memory page
- **Indirect addressing**: the holding spot is a another memory location maybe on a different page
- **Base + Offset addressing**: base value is stored in one the CPU registers and an offset is given for the operand
- **Virtual Memory**: a pagefile that exists on a hard disk

## Basis Input/Output System (BIOS)
- OS independent primitives to start a computer and load the OS
- **phlashing**: installing a malicious version of BIOS

## Unified Extentisible Firmware Interface (UEFI)
- More advanced interface between hardware and software
- Supports legacy BIOS
