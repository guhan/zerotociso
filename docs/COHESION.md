# Team Cohesion

## Culture
Good team culture exists when team members directly drive positive outcomes. 

Characteristics of bad team culture: 
- Blame Culture: A constant focus on all the things that are wrong, and little time spent working on solutions to fix the problems. 
- No ownership: Not having clearly assigned responsibilties and feeling like tasks are outside your area of responsibility. People don't take initiative to go the extra mile to make things better.  
- Poor Communication: Information flows are incomplete and do not reach stakeholders. Not enough time is given to process the communication. Reception of the communication is not validated. 
- Fear of speaking up/reprisal: An authoritarian structure that limits growth and hides problems that will be impactful.
