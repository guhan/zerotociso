# Inter Process Communication (IPC)
Inter-Process Communication (IPC) refers to the mechanisms and techniques that allow processes, which can be separate programs or threads running on a computer, to communicate with each other and share data. IPC is essential for coordinating activities, sharing information, and enabling collaboration between different processes in a multi-tasking or multi-threaded operating system environment. 

## Shared Memory
Processes can share a region of memory, allowing them to read and write data directly to that memory space. This is a very efficient method of IPC because data can be exchanged without the need for copying it between processes. However, it requires careful synchronization to avoid conflicts.
## Message Passing
In message passing, processes communicate by sending and receiving messages. Messages can be sent via various communication mechanisms, including pipes, sockets, or message queues. Message passing is often used in distributed systems and network communication.
## Pipes and FIFOs
Pipes and FIFOs (First-In, First-Out) are used for communication between processes within the same system. Pipes are typically unidirectional, while FIFOs are bidirectional. These are commonly used for IPC in Unix-based systems.
## Sockets
Sockets are used for communication between processes over a network. They enable inter-process communication between processes running on different machines or on the same machine.
## Message Queues
Message queues provide a mechanism for processes to send and receive messages asynchronously. They are often used for managing communication between different parts of an application or between different applications.
## Signals
Signals are a form of IPC that allows one process to notify another process about a particular event or condition, such as a process terminating or encountering an error. Signals are often used for process management.
## Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)
RPC is a high-level mechanism that allows one process to invoke a procedure or function in another process, which may be on a different machine. It's commonly used in distributed computing.
## Named Pipes
Named pipes, also known as FIFOs, provide a way for processes to communicate through a special type of file. They are similar to regular pipes but can be used for communication between unrelated processes.
## Memory-Mapped Files
Memory-mapped files allow processes to map a file into their address space, enabling them to share data by reading and writing to the memory-mapped region.
## Distributed Middleware
Distributed middleware, such as message brokers or distributed databases, facilitates communication and data sharing between processes across a network.
