- Security Measures: The policy may include instructions for users to follow security best practices, such as using strong passwords, regularly updating software, and safeguarding sensitive information.
- Access and Authorization: The AUP defines who is authorized to access specific resources, how access is granted or revoked, and the consequences of unauthorized access.
