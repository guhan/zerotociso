# SELINUX with Kubernetes
Configuring SELinux for use with Kubernetes involves several considerations to ensure that SELinux enhances the security of your Kubernetes cluster while allowing it to function correctly. 

## [Enable SELinux](SELINUX.md)
Ensure that SELinux is enabled on all nodes in your Kubernetes cluster. SELinux should be set to "enforcing" mode. You can check the current mode using the getenforce command and change it using the setenforce command.
## Use SELinux Policy Modules
Consider using SELinux policy modules specifically designed for Kubernetes. Projects like "container-selinux" provide pre-built SELinux policy modules tailored for containerized environments. These modules help enforce proper access controls for containers running in Kubernetes.
## Avoid Privilege Escalation
Configure SELinux to prevent processes from transitioning to higher privilege levels unless explicitly required. Limit the use of permissive or unconfined policies. Instead, focus on enforcing tight access controls.
## Label Kubernetes Resources
Ensure that Kubernetes resources, such as pods, services, and volumes, have appropriate SELinux labels. Kubernetes usually manages this automatically, but it's essential to verify that the labels match your security requirements.
## Audit and Monitor
Enable SELinux auditing to track security events and monitor potential policy violations. Review SELinux audit logs regularly to identify and address any policy violations or issues.
## Test and Validate
Before deploying applications to your Kubernetes cluster, thoroughly test them in a controlled environment to ensure they work correctly with SELinux enabled. Use tools like audit2allow to generate SELinux policy modules for applications that encounter denials.
## Implement Network Policies
Complement SELinux with Kubernetes Network Policies to control network traffic between pods. Network Policies help enforce network segmentation and enhance security.
## Regularly Update SELinux Policies
Keep SELinux policy modules up to date to align with changes in your Kubernetes environment and application stack. Policy updates may be necessary when deploying new applications or making changes to existing ones.
## Documentation and Training
Educate your team about SELinux and its interaction with Kubernetes. Ensure that system administrators and developers understand how to troubleshoot SELinux-related issues.
## Consider Third-Party Tools
Explore third-party tools and solutions that can help streamline SELinux management in a Kubernetes environment. Some tools can automate policy generation and simplify troubleshooting.
## Backup and Recovery
Regularly back up your SELinux policies and configurations to facilitate quick recovery in case of accidental changes or policy misconfigurations.
## Compliance and Hardening
Depending on your organization's requirements, consider industry-specific compliance standards (e.g., CIS Kubernetes Benchmark) and SELinux hardening guidelines to further enhance security.
