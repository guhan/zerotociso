# Real User Monitoring (RUM)
RUM stands for "Real User Monitoring," and it refers to a type of performance monitoring that focuses on tracking and analyzing the experiences of real users interacting with a website, web application, or digital service. RUM provides insights into how actual users perceive and interact with a digital product in real-time, helping organizations assess the performance, usability, and overall quality of their online services. It is an essential part of web application and user experience monitoring.


## User-Centric Monitoring
RUM collects data from actual users' devices and browsers as they interact with a website or application. This data reflects the user's perspective, including their device, network conditions, and the performance they experience.
## Performance Metrics
RUM captures various performance metrics that matter to users, such as page load times, rendering times, response times for API calls, and other interactions. These metrics are crucial for understanding how responsive and fast a digital service feels to users.
## Real-Time Data
RUM provides real-time insights into user interactions and experiences. It allows organizations to identify and address performance issues as they occur, helping to ensure a seamless user experience.
## Geographic and Device Diversity
RUM data often includes information about the geographic locations of users, the devices and browsers they use, and the network conditions they encounter. This data can help organizations optimize their services for different user segments.
## Usability Insights
Beyond performance metrics, RUM can capture data on user interactions, such as clicks, form submissions, and user journeys. This information can be used to analyze user behavior and identify usability issues.
## Error Monitoring
RUM can detect and report errors that users encounter during their interactions with a digital service, such as broken links, JavaScript errors, and failed API requests.
## Conversion and Funnel Analysis
Organizations can use RUM data to analyze user conversions, drop-off rates, and the effectiveness of sales funnels or user flows. This helps improve user engagement and conversion rates.
## Third-Party Service Monitoring
RUM can also monitor the performance and impact of third-party services (e.g., content delivery networks, analytics scripts) on the user experience.

## What is RUM used for?
Organizations use RUM data to:

- Identify and diagnose performance bottlenecks.
- Prioritize performance optimization efforts based on user impact.
- Monitor the effects of code changes and updates on user experience.
- Ensure that service-level agreements (SLAs) related to performance are met.
- Enhance user satisfaction and retention by providing a smooth and responsive experience.
