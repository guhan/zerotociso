# ISO 27031 Information technology — Security techniques — Guidelines for information and communication technology readiness for business continuity.
ISO/IEC 27031 is an international standard titled "Information technology — Security techniques — Guidelines for information and communication technology readiness for business continuity." Published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), ISO/IEC 27031 provides guidance and best practices for organizations to assess and enhance their readiness to ensure the continuity of information and communication technology (ICT) services in the event of disruptions or disasters.

## Business Continuity and ICT
The standard focuses on the integration of ICT-related considerations into an organization's broader business continuity management (BCM) framework. It recognizes the critical role that ICT plays in supporting essential business functions.
## Coordination
ISO/IEC 27031 emphasizes the importance of coordination between business continuity management and ICT management functions within an organization. Effective coordination ensures that ICT services align with overall business continuity objectives.
## ICT Services
The standard addresses various aspects of ICT services, including hardware, software, networks, data, and applications. It helps organizations identify and prioritize critical ICT services that must be maintained during disruptions.

## ICT Recovery Strategies
The standard provides guidance on developing and implementing recovery strategies for ICT services, which may include backup and restoration procedures, redundancy, failover mechanisms, and alternative service delivery options.
## Testing and Exercises
ISO/IEC 27031 encourages organizations to conduct testing, drills, and exercises to validate the effectiveness of ICT recovery plans. Regular testing helps ensure that ICT services can be restored within acceptable timeframes.
## Resource Availability
It addresses the availability of ICT resources, including personnel, equipment, and facilities, to support continuity efforts.
## Documentation
The standard emphasizes the need for comprehensive documentation of ICT continuity plans, procedures, and configurations to facilitate recovery efforts.
## Communication and Reporting
ISO/IEC 27031 underscores the importance of clear communication and reporting mechanisms during disruptions, ensuring that relevant stakeholders are informed and that recovery efforts are coordinated effectively.
## Continuous Improvement
Organizations are encouraged to continuously review and update their ICT continuity plans to reflect changes in technology, business processes, and threats.
