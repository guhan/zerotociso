## NIST 800-30
[View Here](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf)

- Provide guidance for conducting risk assessments of federal information systems and organizations
- Reference ratings for risks, used in qualitative risk analysis. 



## NIST 800-53
Provides a comprehensive set of security controls and guidelines for securing information systems and organizations

The key areas are: 
- Security Control Families: The controls are organized into families, each addressing a specific security objective. Examples of control families include "Access Control," "Audit and Accountability," "System and Communications Protection," and more.
- Security Control Baselines: NIST 800-53 provides three security control baselines: low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact. These baselines are tailored for different types of information systems based on their risk levels and sensitivity.
- Control Enhancements: Within each control family, there are control enhancements that provide additional measures to increase security capabilities and address specific risks.
- Continuous Monitoring: NIST 800-53 emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring and assessment of security controls to ensure ongoing effectiveness and adaptability to changing threats and risks.
- Mapping to Other Frameworks: NIST 800-53 provides mappings to other security and privacy frameworks, such as ISO/IEC 27001, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and more. This enables organizations to align their security efforts with multiple standards.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
Developed in 2014 it is a voluntary framework that provides a set of guidelines, best practices, and standards that organizations can use to assess and strengthen their cybersecurity posture

The key areas are: 
- Core Functions: The NIST CSF defines five core cybersecurity functions, which represent the high-level goals and activities that organizations should consider to achieve effective cybersecurity risk management. These functions are:
  - a. Identify: Understand and manage cybersecurity risks to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.
  - b. Protect: Implement safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical services and protection of assets.
  - c. Detect: Develop and implement activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
  - d. Respond: Develop and implement activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.
  - e. Recover: Develop and implement activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.
- Categories and Subcategories: Under each core function, the NIST CSF provides categories and subcategories that define specific outcomes and activities related to cybersecurity risk management. These categories and subcategories help organizations understand the areas they need to focus on to achieve their cybersecurity objectives.
- Informative References: The NIST CSF includes a list of informative references to other relevant standards, guidelines, and best practices that can complement and support the implementation of the framework.


## NIST 800-61
The NIST Special Publication 800-61 outlines best practices and procedures for **handling various types of security incidents**, such as data breaches, malware infections, denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, and more. It emphasizes the importance of having a well-defined incident response plan and a coordinated approach to managing security incidents.

The key topics covered in NIST 800-61 include:

- **Incident Response Overview**: An introduction to incident response, its importance, and the various phases of incident handling.
- **Incident Handling Preparation**: This section focuses on the necessary steps for preparing an organization to effectively respond to incidents. This includes creating an incident response policy, forming an incident response team, and establishing communication protocols.
- **Incident Detection and Analysis**: Guidance on how to detect and analyze security incidents, including the identification of indicators of compromise (IOCs) and the collection of relevant data for investigation.
- **Incident Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**: This section details the steps to take once an incident is identified, including containing the incident to prevent further damage, eradicating the root cause, and recovering affected systems to normal operation.
- **Post-Incident Activity**: Advice on analyzing the incident response process, documenting lessons learned, and using the information to improve future incident handling.
- **Legal and Regulatory Considerations**: Information about legal and regulatory aspects of incident handling, such as reporting requirements and evidence preservation.

## NIST 800-63b
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-63B Digital Identity Guidelines provide best practices related to **authentication and password lifecycle management**. In this publication, NIST outlines several best practices to bolster their password security. 

Letâ€™s take a look at the following NIST recommendations related to end-users changing their passwords:
- Check passwords against breached password lists
- Block passwords contained in password dictionaries
- Prevent the use of repetitive or incremental passwords
- Disallow context-specific words as passwords
- Increase the length of passwords

## NIST 800-88r1
Provides guidelines and recommendations for effectively sanitizing or securely disposing of information stored on various types of media and devices.
The document covers a wide range of media types, including hard drives, solid-state drives, magnetic tapes, optical media, USB drives, and more. It outlines different methods and techniques for sanitization, including clearing, purging, and destroying the media.

## NIST SP 800-137
NIST Special Publication 800-137, titled "Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal Information Systems and Organizations," is a document published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States. It provides guidelines and recommendations for implementing an Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) program within federal agencies and organizations to enhance the security of their information systems.

Continuous Monitoring Overview: The document outlines the concept of continuous monitoring and its importance in maintaining the security of information systems.
ISCM Framework: NIST SP 800-137 describes the ISCM framework, which includes establishing a monitoring strategy, implementing security controls, conducting ongoing assessments, and reporting and responding to security incidents.
Monitoring Objectives: It discusses the objectives of continuous monitoring, which include identifying vulnerabilities, detecting security incidents, measuring security effectiveness, and providing timely situational awareness.
Monitoring Approaches: The publication provides guidance on various monitoring approaches, including automated and manual monitoring, and emphasizes the importance of risk-based monitoring.
Security Controls: It highlights the role of security controls in continuous monitoring and discusses how organizations can use controls to protect their information systems.
Ongoing Assessments: NIST SP 800-137 describes the processes involved in conducting ongoing security assessments, including vulnerability scanning, configuration management, and security assessments and authorizations.
Reporting and Response: It discusses the reporting of monitoring results and the importance of timely response to security incidents and vulnerabilities.
Integration with Other Security Processes: The document emphasizes the integration of continuous monitoring with other security processes, such as incident response, risk management, and security assessment and authorization (A&A) processes.
Tools and Technologies: It provides insights into the tools and technologies that can support continuous monitoring efforts.
Roles and Responsibilities: NIST SP 800-137 discusses the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders involved in continuous monitoring, including system owners, security teams, and leadership.
Compliance and Metrics: It addresses compliance with security standards and metrics that can be used to measure the effectiveness of the ISCM program.

## NIST SP 800-171
NIST SP 800-171 has gained popularity due to requirements set by the U.S. Department of Defense regarding contractor compliance with security frameworks.
