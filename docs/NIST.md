## NIST 800-30
[View Here](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf)

- Provide guidance for conducting risk assessments of federal information systems and organizations
- Reference ratings for risks, used in qualitative risk analysis. 



## NIST 800-53
Provides a comprehensive set of security controls and guidelines for securing information systems and organizations

The key areas are: 
- Security Control Families: The controls are organized into families, each addressing a specific security objective. Examples of control families include "Access Control," "Audit and Accountability," "System and Communications Protection," and more.
- Security Control Baselines: NIST 800-53 provides three security control baselines: low-impact, moderate-impact, and high-impact. These baselines are tailored for different types of information systems based on their risk levels and sensitivity.
- Control Enhancements: Within each control family, there are control enhancements that provide additional measures to increase security capabilities and address specific risks.
- Continuous Monitoring: NIST 800-53 emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring and assessment of security controls to ensure ongoing effectiveness and adaptability to changing threats and risks.
- Mapping to Other Frameworks: NIST 800-53 provides mappings to other security and privacy frameworks, such as ISO/IEC 27001, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and more. This enables organizations to align their security efforts with multiple standards.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
Developed in 2014 it is a voluntary framework that provides a set of guidelines, best practices, and standards that organizations can use to assess and strengthen their cybersecurity posture

The key areas are: 
- Core Functions: The NIST CSF defines five core cybersecurity functions, which represent the high-level goals and activities that organizations should consider to achieve effective cybersecurity risk management. These functions are:
  - a. Identify: Understand and manage cybersecurity risks to systems, assets, data, and capabilities.
  - b. Protect: Implement safeguards to ensure the delivery of critical services and protection of assets.
  - c. Detect: Develop and implement activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event.
  - d. Respond: Develop and implement activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident.
  - e. Recover: Develop and implement activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore any capabilities or services that were impaired due to a cybersecurity incident.
- Categories and Subcategories: Under each core function, the NIST CSF provides categories and subcategories that define specific outcomes and activities related to cybersecurity risk management. These categories and subcategories help organizations understand the areas they need to focus on to achieve their cybersecurity objectives.
- Informative References: The NIST CSF includes a list of informative references to other relevant standards, guidelines, and best practices that can complement and support the implementation of the framework.

## NIST 800-63b
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-63B Digital Identity Guidelines provide best practices related to authentication and password lifecycle management. In this publication, NIST outlines several best practices to bolster their password security. 

Letâ€™s take a look at the following NIST recommendations related to end-users changing their passwords:
- Check passwords against breached password lists
- Block passwords contained in password dictionaries
- Prevent the use of repetitive or incremental passwords
- Disallow context-specific words as passwords
- Increase the length of passwords

## NIST 800-88r1
Provides guidelines and recommendations for effectively sanitizing or securely disposing of information stored on various types of media and devices.
The document covers a wide range of media types, including hard drives, solid-state drives, magnetic tapes, optical media, USB drives, and more. It outlines different methods and techniques for sanitization, including clearing, purging, and destroying the media.

## NIST SP 800-171
NIST SP 800-171 has gained popularity due to requirements set by the U.S. Department of Defense regarding contractor compliance with security frameworks. 


## NIST 800-190
A special guide to address [application container security](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.pdf).

## NIST SP 1800 Series
The NIST SP 1800 Series is a set of guides that complement the NIST SP 800 Series of standards and frameworks. The SP 1800 Series of publications offers information on how to implement and apply standards-based cybersecurity technologies in real-world applications.
