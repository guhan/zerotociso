# ACID
ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. It is a set of properties that guarantee the reliability and consistency of transactions in a database management system (DBMS). ACID properties are crucial for ensuring the integrity of data and the correctness of operations, particularly in systems where multiple transactions can occur concurrently.

## Atomicity
Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. It means that either all the operations within a transaction are successfully completed, or none of them are.
If any part of a transaction fails (e.g., due to an error or exception), the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database remains unchanged.

## Consistency
Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one consistent state to another. In other words, a transaction should not violate any integrity constraints or business rules.
If a transaction violates any rules or constraints, it is rolled back, and the database remains in its original state.

## Isolation
Isolation guarantees that concurrent execution of multiple transactions does not interfere with each other. Each transaction should appear to execute in isolation, as if it were the only transaction being processed.
Isolation is typically achieved through locking mechanisms or other isolation levels (e.g., READ COMMITTED, SERIALIZABLE) to prevent conflicts and maintain data integrity.

## Durability
Durability ensures that once a transaction is successfully committed (i.e., its changes are saved to the database), those changes will persist, even in the face of system failures (e.g., power outages or crashes).
This property ensures that data remains intact and recoverable in the long term, providing confidence in the reliability of the database system.
