# Serialization
Serialization is the process of taking structured data and converting it to a format where it takes up less storage space. 

## What is a protocol buffer? 
Protocol Buffers, often referred to as Protobuf, is a language-agnostic binary serialization format developed by Google. It is designed to efficiently serialize structured data into a compact binary representation for storage or transmission and then deserialize it back into its original form. Protobuf is particularly popular in scenarios where efficiency, speed, and cross-platform compatibility are essential, such as communication between distributed systems and data storage.

Key characteristics and features of Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) include:

- **Efficiency**: Protobuf uses a binary encoding format that is more compact and faster to serialize and deserialize compared to human-readable formats like JSON or XML. This efficiency is crucial in scenarios where data size and processing speed are critical factors.
- **Language-Agnostic**: Protobuf is language-agnostic, meaning you can define data structures and messages in a .proto file and then use language-specific code generators (e.g., protoc compiler) to generate language-specific code for serialization and deserialization in various programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, Go, and more.
- **Forward and Backward Compatibility**: Protobuf supports evolving data schemas while maintaining backward and forward compatibility. New fields can be added to messages without breaking existing clients or servers, as unrecognized fields are safely ignored.
- **Strong Typing**: Protobuf enforces strong typing for data structures, allowing developers to define the data model with specific data types (e.g., integers, strings, enums) and ensuring that data conforms to the defined schema.
- **Extensibility**: Protobuf supports message extensions, which allow third-party developers to add fields to existing messages without modifying the original .proto file. This is useful for building plugin systems and libraries that can extend existing Protobuf messages.
- **Language Features**: Protobuf provides features like default values, optional and required fields, enums, and more to define the structure and constraints of messages.
- **Code Generation**: The protoc compiler generates code in target programming languages from the .proto definition files, making it easier for developers to work with Protobuf in their chosen language.
- **Support for Streaming**: Protobuf can be used to define streaming APIs, where data is sent and received in a continuous stream rather than as discrete messages.
