# Team Topologies

## Stream-Aligned Teams

- A “stream” is the continuous flow of work aligned to a single business domain or org capability. A stream-aligned team is aligned to a single, valuable stream of work like a single product or service, a set of features, or even a user journey or user persona. This team is empowered to build and deliver value quickly, safely, and (this is key) independently. There shouldn’t be any hand-offs to other teams to complete parts of the work. They “own” it from beginning to end.

- Stream-aligned teams should be the primary team type in an organization. All other team types exist to reduce the burden on stream-aligned teams.

- Stream-aligned teams should be close to the customer so they can quickly incorporate feedback and monitor their software in production. This allows the stream-aligned team to react in near real-time and adapt to changes as needed. They are quick, agile, dedicated.

## Enabling Teams

- An enabling team bridges the capability gap. In Accelerate, we learn that high-performing teams are continuously improving their capabilities to stay ahead of the curve. This is difficult when you have end-to-end ownership of a value stream (as in stream-aligned teams). With all that work, it can be hard to find the time for research, learning, and practicing new skills.

- Enabling teams are composed of specialists in a given domain of knowledge, which might be more technical, or more product-focused, or any other domain where there is a gap in skills in (part of) the organization. They cross-cut to stream-aligned teams and have the bandwidth for research, experimentation, etc. They bring this knowledge and expertise back to the stream-aligned team.

- A successful enabling team should be strongly collaborative in nature. They must work to understand the problems faced by the stream-aligned team and then provide proper guidance. Enabling teams must avoid becoming an “ivory tower” of knowledge. They do not exist to dictate technical choices. Instead, an enabling team helps stream-aligned teams understand and comply with organization-wide constraints. They are the “servant leaders” of the team types.

## Complicated-Subsystem Teams

- The complicated-subsystem team is responsible for building and maintaining a system that requires heavy specialist knowledge. Each member on the team should be a specialist in that area of knowledge and be able to make changes to the subsystem.

- The goal of the complicated-subsystem team is to reduce the cognitive load of stream-aligned teams working on the system. This is more cost effective than embedding a specialist onto every stream-aligned team, and avoids distracting the stream-aligned team from their main goal of delivery value.

## Platform Teams

- A platform team enables a stream-aligned team to deliver work with substantial autonomy by providing internal services to reduce their cognitive load. A digital platform, as defined by Evan Bottcher, is

. . . a foundation of self-service APIs, tools, services, knowledge and support which are arranged as a compelling internal product. Autonomous delivery teams can make use of the platform to deliver product features at a higher pace, with reduced coordination.

- The platform team’s knowledge is made available via self-service capabilities on the web or via a programmable API. These should be made easy for the stream-aligned teams to consume, instead of lengthy instruction manuals.

- Ease of use is fundamental to successful product teams.
