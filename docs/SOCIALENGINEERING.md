# Social Engineering

# What is social engineering?
Social engineering is a technique used by malicious individuals to manipulate and deceive people into 
performing actions or divulging confidential information. It exploits human psychology and 
emotions to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks, data, or physical spaces. Social 
engineering attacks often rely on trust, fear, urgency, curiosity, or a combination of these 
factors to manipulate individuals into bypassing security measures.

Types of social engineering attacks include:

- Phishing: Attackers send fraudulent emails, messages, or websites that appear to be from legitimate
  sources, aiming to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information like passwords, credit card
  details, or login credentials.
- Pretexting: Attackers create a fabricated scenario or pretext to gain the target's trust and extract
  information or access. This could involve posing as a co-worker, vendor, or other trusted individual.
- Baiting: Attackers use enticing offers, such as free software downloads or USB drives, to lure victims
  into unknowingly installing malware or disclosing sensitive information.
- Quid Pro Quo: Attackers offer something in exchange for sensitive information, such as pretending to be
  IT support and offering to fix a problem in exchange for login credentials.
- Tailgating (Piggybacking): Attackers physically follow an authorized person into a restricted area by
  pretending to be an employee, visitor, or contractor.
- Impersonation: Attackers pose as someone with authority, like an executive or a technical support
  agent, to manipulate individuals into divulging sensitive information.
- Reverse Social Engineering: Attackers first gain the victim's trust and then ask the victim to perform
  actions that compromise security, often by playing on the victim's emotions.
- Pharming: Attackers manipulate DNS settings or use malware to redirect users to malicious websites,
  even if they enter the correct URL.
- Watering Hole: Attackers compromise a legitimate website that their targets frequently visit,
  infecting visitors with malware.

# How to prevent Social Engineering? 
Stopping social engineering requires a combination of security measures, awareness, and vigilance. 
While it's challenging to completely eliminate the risk, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of 
falling victim to social engineering attacks by following these steps:

- Security Awareness Training:
Educate yourself and your team about different social engineering tactics, how to recognize suspicious
activities, and best practices for handling sensitive information. Regularly refresh this training to
keep everyone informed about the latest threats.
- Verify Requests:
Always verify the identity of individuals making requests for sensitive information, access, or actions.
Use known contact information, rather than the information provided in the communication, to confirm the request.
- Implement Strong Authentication:
Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible. MFA requires additional verification beyond a
password, making it much harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access. Never give out or change passwords
over voice only communications. 
- Limit Access to Information:
Only provide information on a need-to-know basis. Limit access to sensitive information and
systems to authorized personnel.
- Classsify Information: Determine what can be given out or confirmed via voice communications
- Regularly Update Software and Systems:
Keep your devices, software, and security solutions up to date to ensure they are protected against
known vulnerabilities.
- Use Email and Web Filters:
Employ email and web filters to help block malicious content, phishing emails, and suspicious websites.
- Implement Network Security Measures:
Use firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and other network security measures to
defend against unauthorized access.
- Be Cautious with Links and Attachments:
Don't click on links or open attachments in unsolicited emails or messages. Hover over links to verify
the destination URL before clicking.
- Monitor Financial Transactions:
Regularly review your financial accounts for unusual activity. Report any suspicious transactions to
your bank or financial institution immediately.
- Create Strong Passwords:
Use complex passwords and avoid using the same password for multiple accounts. Consider using a password
manager to keep track of your passwords securely.
- Report Suspicious Activity:
Encourage a culture of reporting within your organization. Establish clear channels for reporting
suspicious emails, phone calls, or encounters.
- Physical Security Measures:
Secure physical access points to your premises. Be cautious of individuals attempting to tailgate or
gain unauthorized access.
- Regularly Test Security Measures:
Conduct security assessments, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing to identify weaknesses
in your security infrastructure.
- Stay Informed:
Stay up to date with the latest social engineering techniques and trends to adjust your security
practices accordingly.
