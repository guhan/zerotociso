# Biometrics




## Error Types
Biometric systems, which use physiological or behavioral characteristics for authentication and identification, can experience various types of errors. These errors are categorized into two main types: false acceptance and false rejection. These errors are often evaluated using the following metrics:

- False Acceptance Rate (FAR):
FAR measures the rate at which the biometric system incorrectly accepts an unauthorized user. In other words, it quantifies the probability that the system mistakenly identifies someone as a valid user when they are not. A lower FAR indicates a more secure system.
- False Rejection Rate (FRR):
FRR measures the rate at which the biometric system incorrectly rejects a legitimate user. It quantifies the probability that the system fails to recognize an authorized user. A lower FRR indicates better usability because it means the system is less likely to deny access to authorized users.
- Equal Error Rate (EER):
EER is the point at which the FAR and FRR are equal. It represents the threshold where the system balances the trade-off between security and usability. A lower EER indicates a more accurate system overall.
- Failure to Enroll (FTE):
FTE occurs when the biometric system fails to enroll or register a user's biometric data accurately. This means that the user cannot be added to the system, preventing them from using biometric authentication.
- Failure to Capture (FTC):
FTC happens when the biometric system is unable to capture the biometric data accurately during the authentication process. This can result from factors like poor sensor quality or environmental conditions that affect data capture.
- Crossover Error Rate (CER):
CER is another metric similar to EER but is often used to evaluate the performance of biometric systems in real-world scenarios. It represents the point at which the FAR and FRR curves cross when plotted against varying thresholds.
- Spoofing and Presentation Attacks:
These errors occur when an attacker attempts to deceive the biometric system by using a forged or stolen biometric sample (e.g., a fingerprint copy or a facial image) to gain unauthorized access. Effective anti-spoofing measures are essential to mitigate these types of errors.
- Biometric Template Vulnerability:
In some cases, biometric templates stored in databases can be subject to theft or unauthorized access, leading to potential security breaches.
- Environmental Factors and User Variability:
Biometric systems may experience errors due to environmental conditions (e.g., poor lighting for facial recognition) or user variability (e.g., changes in a person's fingerprint due to injury).
- Interoperability Issues:
Biometric systems may encounter compatibility issues when integrating with other systems or databases, leading to errors in data exchange and authentication.

## Type 1
A Type 1 biometric error, in the context of biometric authentication, is a **false acceptance** or false match error. It occurs when the biometric system incorrectly identifies an unauthorized user as a legitimate or authorized individual, granting them access to a system, facility, or resource they should not have.

Type 1 biometric errors are associated with the False Acceptance Rate (FAR), which measures the rate at which the biometric system incorrectly accepts impostors or unauthorized users. A higher FAR indicates that the system is more likely to make Type 1 errors, allowing unauthorized access.

Type 1 errors can pose significant security risks because they result in unauthorized individuals gaining access to protected systems or sensitive areas. Therefore, minimizing Type 1 errors is crucial for maintaining the security of a biometric authentication system. This can be achieved by using robust biometric recognition algorithms, implementing anti-spoofing measures to detect impersonation attempts, and regularly updating and calibrating the biometric sensors and systems to improve accuracy.

## Type 2
A Type 2 biometric error, in the context of biometric authentication, is a **false rejection** or false non-match error. It occurs when a legitimate user or individual who should be granted access to a system or facility is incorrectly denied access by the biometric system. In other words, the system fails to recognize the user as an authorized person.

Type 2 biometric errors are associated with the False Rejection Rate (FRR), which measures the rate at which the biometric system incorrectly rejects legitimate users. A higher FRR indicates that the system is more likely to make Type 2 errors, resulting in denied access for authorized individuals. This can be frustrating for users and can impact the usability and convenience of the biometric system.
