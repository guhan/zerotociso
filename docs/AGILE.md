Scaled Agile Framework

- Team - individual team scrum/kanban

- Portfolio - overall product management  - strategic planning and alignment of business goals with the overall agile delivery. It involves managing a portfolio backlog, prioritizing initiatives, and making strategic decisions based on market and customer feedback

### Rituals
- Value Streams: the end-to-end flow of value delivery to customers. Value streams are cross-functional,
- Agile Release Train (ART): a long-lived team of teams that works together on a specific value stream. 
regular inspect-and-adapt cycles, including the PI System Demo, where teams showcase their work, gather feedback, and identify opportunities for improvement.
- Program Increment (PI) Planning: 2-3 days  every 8-12 weeks. The teams align their objectives, dependencies, and priorities, creating a shared plan for the PI.
- Iteration (or Sprint) Planning: This is a recurring event that takes place at the beginning of each iteration (or sprint). Individual teams within the ART plan their work for the upcoming iteration, breaking down features into user stories, estimating effort, and committing to a set of work items to be delivered within the iteration.
- Daily Stand-ups: Daily Stand-ups, or Daily Scrum meetings, are short daily meetings held by individual teams. Team members provide updates on their progress, discuss any challenges or impediments they are facing, and synchronize their activities. The focus is on coordination and visibility within the team.
- System Demo: At the end of each iteration, a System Demo is conducted. Teams present the work they have completed during the iteration to stakeholders, including other teams, product owners, and management. 
- Inspect and Adapt (I&A) Workshop: The I&A Workshop is a recurring event held at the end of each Program Increment. It focuses on inspecting the progress and performance of the ART, identifying areas for improvement, and planning adjustments for the next PI. The workshop includes a retrospective, problem-solving sessions, and planning for continuous improvement.
- Scrum of Scrums (SoS): The SoS meeting is a coordination event that occurs regularly, bringing together representatives from individual teams within the ART. It provides a forum for teams to discuss progress, dependencies, and any cross-team issues. The goal is to ensure alignment and collaboration across teams.
- ART Sync: ART Sync meetings are conducted at the end of each iteration or at other designated intervals. These meetings allow teams within the ART to synchronize their work and ensure that dependencies are addressed, risks are mitigated, and impediments are resolved.
- Management Reviews: Management Reviews are periodic meetings where key stakeholders, including management and business leaders, review the progress, outcomes, and impact of the ART. They provide oversight, make strategic decisions, and ensure alignment with organizational goals.
