### CAC
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): In business and marketing, CAC refers to the cost a company incurs to acquire a new customer. It is calculated by dividing the total cost of acquiring customers (such as advertising expenses, marketing costs, and sales team salaries) by the number of new customers gained during a specific period.

### Magic Number
This metric is used to assess the efficiency of a SaaS company's sales and marketing efforts in relation to its revenue growth
Magic Number = Quarterly Growth in Recurring Revenue (QoQ) / Sales and Marketing Expense as a Percentage of Previous Quarter’s Revenue (QoQ)

A value greater than 0.4 is often considered positive, indicating that the company is efficiently using its sales and marketing resources to drive revenue growth. A Magic Number less than 0.4 might suggest that the company is spending too much relative to the revenue it is generating
