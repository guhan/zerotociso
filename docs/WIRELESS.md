# Wireless Networking

## Key Concepts
- **Wireless Access Point (WAP)**
- **Site Survey**: checking the presence, strength, and reach of WAPs
- **Captive Portal**: redirects wireless client to a portal access control page

## Wireless Access Points
- infrastructure mode: a wireless access point (WAP) is required
- adhoc mode: any two wireless devices can communicate without a centralized control authority
- service set identified (SSID): misused to indicate the name of the wireless network
- basic service set identifier (BSSID): in infrastructure mode, it is the MAC address of the base station
  hosting the ESSID. 
- extended service set identifier (ESSID): nsuedame of a wireless network when a base station is used
- independent service set identifier (ISSID): when ad-hoc or peer to peer mode i 
- wireless channels: within a wireless signal there are subdivisions called channels. Access points that
  are close to each other should be on different channels.

## Antenna Types
- Omnidirectional: Straight pole
- Directional:
  - Yagi
  - Cantenna
  - Panel

## Wireless Encryption Protocols
- Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP): predefined shared key, insecure
- WiFi Protected Access (WPA): T
- Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP): TKIP is a specific encryption protocol that was introduced as part of WPA to improve security over the older WEP encryption. TKIP dynamically generates encryption keys for each data packet, making it much harder to crack compared to the static keys used in WEP.

## Securing Wireless
- Disable broadcasting of the SSID
- MAC filter: only let known MAC addresses join
