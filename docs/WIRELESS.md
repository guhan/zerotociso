# Wireless Networking

## Key Concepts
- Wireless Access Point (WAP)
- site survey: checking the presence, strength, and reach of WAPs


## Wireless Access Points
- infrastructure mode: a wireless access point (WAP) is required
- adhoc mode: any two wireless devices can communicate without a centralized control authority
- service set identified (SSID): misused to indicate the name of the wireless network
- basic service set identifier (BSSID): in infrastructure mode, it is the MAC address of the base station
  hosting the ESSID. 
- extended service set identifier (ESSID): nsuedame of a wireless network when a base station is used
- independent service set identifier (ISSID): when ad-hoc or peer to peer mode i 
- wireless channels: within a wireless signal there are subdivisions called channels. Access points that
  are close to each other should be on different channels.


  ## Securing Wireless
  - Disable broadcasting of the SSID
  - MAC filter: only let known MAC addresses join
