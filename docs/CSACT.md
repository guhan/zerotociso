#  Computer Security Act (CSA)
1987

Enacted to improve the security and privacy of sensitive information in federal computer systems. 

Key provisions of the Computer Security Act of 1987 include:

- Security Standards: The law required federal agencies to develop and implement security plans and practices for their computer systems. This included the establishment of security standards and guidelines to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access, disclosure, and modification.
- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Involvement: The act assigned the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) with the responsibility of developing standards and guidelines for federal computer security. NIST's role included providing agencies with technical guidance and assistance in implementing security measures.
- Sensitive Systems Review: The act mandated that federal agencies identify and categorize their computer systems based on the sensitivity of the information they processed. More sensitive systems required higher levels of security.
- Security Training and Awareness: The law emphasized the importance of security training and awareness programs for federal employees who had access to sensitive computer systems and information.
- Coordination and Reporting: The act called for coordination among federal agencies to ensure consistent and effective implementation of computer security practices. It also required agencies to report to Congress on their progress in meeting the act's requirements.
- Public Access: The Computer Security Act emphasized that its provisions were not intended to prevent public access to government information. It sought to balance security needs with the principle of openness in government operations.
