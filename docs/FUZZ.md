# Fuzz Testing
Fuzzing, also known as fuzz testing or fuzz analysis, is a software testing technique used to identify vulnerabilities and defects in computer programs, applications, or systems. The primary goal of fuzzing is to discover unexpected or anomalous behavior in software by providing it with malformed, unexpected, or random input data. Fuzzing helps uncover security vulnerabilities, software crashes, and other issues that may not be apparent through traditional testing methods.

## Input Mutation
Fuzzing tools generate a large volume of test inputs by randomly or systematically mutating valid input data. These mutations often involve altering data structures, manipulating file formats, or injecting unexpected values.
## Automated Testing
Fuzzing is highly automated. Fuzzing tools automatically generate and submit test inputs to the target software, monitor its behavior, and log any crashes or abnormal responses.
## Exploratory Testing
Fuzzing explores the software's input space thoroughly, seeking to uncover vulnerabilities that may not be obvious to testers. It aims to trigger edge cases and unexpected conditions.
## Crash Detection
One of the primary goals of fuzzing is to identify software crashes, hangs, or memory corruption issues. These crashes can be indicative of security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows.
## Security Testing
Fuzzing is widely used for security testing, including finding vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and injection flaws in applications and protocols.
## Protocol Fuzzing
Fuzzing is commonly used to test network protocols, including communication protocols used in web applications, IoT devices, and network services. Protocol fuzzing helps identify vulnerabilities in networked software.
## Mutation-Based and Generation-Based Fuzzing
Fuzzing can be categorized into mutation-based and generation-based approaches. 
- Mutation-based fuzzing starts with valid inputs and applies mutations
- generation-based fuzzing creates entirely new inputs based on a defined grammar or format.
## Feedback Loop
Effective fuzzing often involves a feedback loop where detected issues are reported, and the testing input generation process is adjusted to explore the areas where vulnerabilities were found.
## Coverage Metrics
Fuzzing tools may track code coverage to measure how much of the target software has been exercised during testing. This helps ensure comprehensive testing.
## File Format Fuzzing
Fuzzing is particularly effective for testing applications that handle files, such as document readers and media players, by generating malformed or unexpected file formats.
## Web Application Fuzzing
Fuzzing can also be applied to web applications to discover vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other security issues.
## Mutation Engines
Fuzzing tools may use different mutation engines to generate test inputs, including random mutation, dictionary-based mutation, and smart mutation techniques.
