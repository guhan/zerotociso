# Federal Reserve

## Key Concepts

- Reserve ratio requirement: how much cash must be held in reserves in relation to deposits
- Discount rate:  overnight, or up to 90 days, banks can borrow at this rate to help liquidity
- Federal funds rate: fed buys or sells treasuries to set this rate. 
- Prime rate: add a few basis points to the federal funds rate and this rate is the base (variable) rate for things like mortgages 
- Interbank lending rate: banks can borrow from each other at this rate 
- Reverse repurchase:  bank sells a treasury, agency bond, agency mortgage backed security to Fed at
  night and agrees to buy it back in the morning for a premium
