# Voice

## Key Concepts
- Private Branch Exchange (PBX)
- Public Switched Telephone Network (POTS)
- Vishing: VoIP phishing
- Spam over Internet Telephone (SPIT)
- Phreaking: hacking a POTS system

## Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
Encapsulates audio into IP packets to support telephone calls over TCP/IP
- CallerID can be easily falsified
- OS, firmware could be vulnerable
- MitM attacks
- 802.1X authentication issues could occur with bad configuration
- unencrypted traffic can be snooped on

## Secure Real Time Transport Protocol (SRTP)
Improvement on the Real Time Transport Protocol (RTP) by minimizing risk of DoS through
robust encryption and authentication

## What are the different phreaking tools?
Phreaking tools are software or hardware tools that are used by individuals to manipulate and exploit telecommunications systems, networks, and services. Phreaking originated as a subculture focused on exploring and exploiting weaknesses in phone systems, but it has evolved to encompass a broader range of technology exploits. It's important to note that many phreaking tools are illegal and unethical, as they are used to gain unauthorized access or disrupt services. Here are some examples of phreaking tools:

- Blue Box:
A blue box is a device that generates tones used in the phone system to make free long-distance calls by simulating the signals used to control the network.
- Red Box:
Similar to a blue box, a red box generates tones that simulate coin drops, allowing users to make free payphone calls.
- Black Box:
A black box exploits vulnerabilities in payphone coin mechanisms, allowing calls without payment.
- White Box: dual tone multifrequency generator (keypad) used to control the phone system and used by most
  telephone repair personnel
- War Dialers:
War dialers automatically dial phone numbers in sequence to identify modems, vulnerable systems, or fax machines. They can be used for legitimate purposes (security testing) or malicious intent.
- Spoofing Tools:
Tools that manipulate caller ID information, making it appear as if a call is coming from a different number. Used for impersonation and social engineering attacks.
- Phreaking Software:
Various software tools designed to manipulate phone systems, such as generating signaling tones, recording phone conversations, or intercepting calls.
- Cellular Phreaking Tools:
Tools used to exploit vulnerabilities in cellular networks, such as cloning SIM cards, intercepting calls and messages, and circumventing carrier controls.
- VoIP Phreaking Tools:
Tools that exploit Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) systems, often used to make unauthorized calls or gain access to VoIP networks.
- Call Deflection Tools:
Tools that redirect incoming calls without the caller's knowledge, allowing attackers to intercept communications.
- Phone Hacking Tools:
Tools that exploit vulnerabilities in smartphones and traditional landline phones, potentially allowing unauthorized access, call interception, and data theft.
- Telecom Testing Tools:
While not always malicious, some testing tools used by telecom professionals can potentially be repurposed for unauthorized use. Examples include tools for analyzing signaling protocols and testing network vulnerabilities.
