# COBIT
COBIT was developed in the mid-1990s by ISACA, an independent organization of IT governance professionals. ISACA offers the well-known Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) and Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) certifications.

COBIT originally focused on reducing IT risks. COBIT 5, released in 2012, included new technology and business trends to help organizations balance IT and business goals. The current version is COBIT 2019. It's the most used framework to achieve Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. 

## Control Objectives for Information Technology (COBIT)
The Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) updated its COBIT framework in 2019 to create a Governance System and Governance Framework. Instead of basing compliance on individual security controls, COBIT 2019 starts with stakeholders’ needs, assigns job-related governance responsibilities to each type, then maps the responsibility back to technologies. Ultimately, COBIT’s goal is to ensure appropriate oversight of the organization’s security posture.

The COBIT core model groups governance and management objectives into five domains:
1. EDM: Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor
2. APO: Align, Plan, and Organization
3. BAI: Build, Acquire, and Implement
4. DSS: Deliver, Service, and Support
5. MEA: Monitor, Evaluate, and Assess

COBIT’s design principles include:
- Understanding the enterprise strategy
- Scoping the governance system
- Refining the scope
- Completing the design

Ultimately, COBIT’s focus on governance creates a security framework that streamlines audits and incorporates continuous improvement to enhance those outcomes.
