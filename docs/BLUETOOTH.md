# Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a wireless communication technology that allows devices to exchange data and connect to one another over short distances, typically within a range of about 10 meters (30 feet). It was developed to enable wireless communication between devices such as smartphones, laptops, headphones, speakers, keyboards, mice, and a wide range of other consumer electronics and accessories.

Key features and characteristics of Bluetooth include:

- **Wireless Connectivity**: Bluetooth eliminates the need for physical cables and connectors, making it a convenient and versatile way to connect devices.
- **Short-Range Communication**: Bluetooth is designed for short-range communication, which is suitable for connecting devices in close proximity to one another, such as within a room or a vehicle.
- **Low Power Consumption**: Bluetooth technology is designed to be energy-efficient, making it suitable for battery-powered devices like smartphones, wireless headphones, and wearable devices.
- **Peer-to-Peer and Multi-Point Connections**: Bluetooth supports peer-to-peer connections between two devices and also allows multi-point connections, where one device can connect to multiple devices simultaneously. For example, you can connect your smartphone to both a Bluetooth headset and a Bluetooth speaker.
- **Pairing and Security**: To establish a connection, devices need to go through a pairing process, which often involves exchanging a secure encryption key. This helps ensure the security and privacy of data transmitted between devices.
- **Bluetooth Profiles**: Bluetooth devices often support specific profiles that define the types of services and features they can provide. Common profiles include Hands-Free Profile (HFP) for headsets, Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) for high-quality audio streaming, and Human Interface Device (HID) profile for input devices like keyboards and mice.
- **Bluetooth Versions**: Bluetooth technology has evolved over the years, with each new version introducing improvements in speed, range, power efficiency, and features. Some notable versions include Bluetooth 1.x, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 (introducing Low Energy or BLE), 4.2, 5.0, 5.1, and 5.2, each with its own set of enhancements.


## Bluetooth Vulnerabilities
- **Bluejacking**: allows attacker to transmit SMS messages on your device
- **Bluesnarfing**: Allows hackers to connect to your bluetooth device and take information without you knowing
- **Bluebugging**: grants hackers remote access to a bluetooth feature on your device
