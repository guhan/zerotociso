# X.25
X.25 is an older telecommunications protocol that was widely used for packet-switched data communication in the early days of computer networking and long-distance data transmission. Developed by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), X.25 was first introduced in the late 1970s and remained in use through the 1980s and into the 1990s. It provided the foundation for many early computer networks and served as the basis for modern packet-switching technologies.

## Packet Switching
X.25 is a packet-switching protocol, meaning that data is divided into packets for transmission over a network. Each packet includes control information, addressing, and the actual data payload.

## Virtual Circuits
X.25 establishes virtual circuits between endpoints, similar to Frame Relay. Virtual circuits are logical connections that provide a path for data to travel between two devices. X.25 supports both switched virtual circuits (SVCs) and permanent virtual circuits (PVCs).

## Error Handling
X.25 includes error detection and correction mechanisms to ensure data integrity over potentially unreliable network connections. It uses techniques like cyclic redundancy checks (CRC) for error detection.

## Flow Control
X.25 incorporates flow control mechanisms to manage the flow of data between sender and receiver, preventing data overload and ensuring efficient transmission.

## DTE and DCE
X.25 distinguishes between Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment (DCE). DTE is typically the user's device (e.g., a computer), while DCE is the networking equipment (e.g., a modem or network switch) that interfaces with the network.

## Addressing
X.25 uses a form of addressing called Data Link Connection Identifier (DLCI) to specify the virtual circuit used for data transmission between endpoints.

## Public Data Networks 
X.25 was commonly used in public data networks, including early versions of the Internet, as a means of connecting remote devices and networks.

## Historical Significance
X.25 played a crucial role in the development of computer networking, particularly during the transition from point-to-point leased lines to more flexible packet-switched networks. It was a foundational technology for early data communications and helped pave the way for modern networking protocols.
