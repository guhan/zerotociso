# PCI DSS
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) was created in 2006 to ensure that all companies that accept, process, store, or transmit credit card information operate securely. The framework is primarily intended to keep cardholder information safe. All companies handling this information must comply with PCI DSS, regardless of size. 

Who itâ€™s for: Any company handling credit card information
Focus: Card owner information security

Unlike government-mandated frameworks, payment brands (MasterCard, Visa, etc.) enforce PCI DSS compliance

1. Build and maintain a secure network and systems
2. Protect cardholder data
