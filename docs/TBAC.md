# Task Based Access Controls (TBAC)
Task-based access controls, also known as task-based access management or role-based access control (RBAC), are a type of access control model used in computer security and identity and access management (IAM) systems. Task-based access controls focus on granting permissions or access rights to users or entities based on the specific tasks or functions they need to perform within an organization's systems or applications.

## Access is Defined by Tasks
Instead of granting users access based solely on their job roles or job titles, access is granted based on the specific tasks or functions that users need to perform. Each task is associated with a set of permissions or access rights.
## Roles and Tasks Are Separate
While roles are still used in task-based access controls, they are not the primary determinant of access. Roles are used to group users who perform similar tasks or functions, but the access permissions are defined at the task level.
## Granular Access Control
Task-based access controls provide a high level of granularity in access management. This means that users can be given precisely the permissions they need to perform their specific tasks, and nothing more.
## Dynamic Assignment
Users can be dynamically assigned tasks and associated permissions based on their current responsibilities or job functions. When a user's role or tasks change, their access rights can be adjusted accordingly.
## Flexible and Scalable
Task-based access controls are adaptable and can scale with the organization's evolving needs. New tasks and access permissions can be easily added as needed.
## Auditability
Because access is tied to specific tasks and permissions, it is easier to track and audit user actions and access patterns.
