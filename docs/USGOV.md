## Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)
The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition and Sustainment (OUSD(A&S)) worked with Department of Defense (DoD) stakeholder, University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs), and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to standardize cybersecurity across the Defense Industrial Base (DIB).
Unlike other maturity models, CMMC is both a set of best practices and a requirement for organizations that solicit DoD contracts. CMMC lists five maturity levels, primarily based on whether the data an organization collects, transmits, stores, and processes is Federal Contract Information (FCI) or Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

The five certification levels are:
- Level 1: Basic safeguarding of FCI and basic cyber hygiene
- Level 2: Documenting and processes the transition phase to prove intermediate cyber hygiene practices for FCI and CUI
- Level 3: Establishing basic CUI protections, managing processes, and developing good cyber hygiene practices
- Level 4: Increasing security over CUI, reducing advanced persistent threat (APT) risks, reviewing processes, and establishing proactive practices
- Level 5: Furthering risk reduction around APTs, optimizing processes, and establishing advanced/progressive practices

As an organization’s maturity level increases, so do the required controls’ number and sophistication level. At Maturity Level 1, an organization only needs seventeen practices. Meanwhile, an organization that needs to meet Maturity Level 5 compliance needs 173 practices in place.


## ITAR
“International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) is a United States regulatory regime to restrict and control the export of defense and military related technologies to safeguard U.S. national security and further U.S. foreign policy objectives.”

Defense-related articles and services on the United States Munitions List (USML)[2] are covered by the regulations.
The United States Munitions List (USML) is a list of articles, services, and related technology designated as defense and space-related by the United States federal government. This designation is pursuant to sections 38 and 47(7) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778 and 2794(7)). 

I:   Firearms, Close Assault Weapons and Combat Shotguns
II:   Materials, Chemicals, Microorganisms, and Toxins
III:   Ammunition/Ordnance
IV:   Launch Vehicles, Guided Missiles, Ballistic Missiles, Rockets, Torpedoes, Bombs and Mines
V:   Explosives and Energetic Materials, Propellants, Incendiary Agents and Their Constituents
VI:   Vessels of War and Special Naval Equipment
VII:   Tanks and Military Vehicles
VIII:   Aircraft and Associated Equipment
IX:   Military Training Equipment
X:   Protective Personnel Equipment
XI:   Military Electronics
XII:   Fire Control, Range Finder, Optical and Guidance and Control Equipment
XIII:   Auxiliary Military Equipment
XIV:   Toxicological Agents, Including Chemical Agents, Biological Agents, and Associated Equipment
XV:   Spacecraft Systems and Associated Equipment
XVI:   Nuclear Weapons, Design and Testing Related Items
XVII:  Classified Articles, Technical Data and Defense Services Not Otherwise Enumerated
XVIII: Directed Energy Weapons
XX:   Submersible Vessels, Oceanographic and Associated Equipment
XXI:   Articles, Technical Data, and Defense Services Not Otherwise Enumerated



Any article, service, or related data found to be on the USML requires an export license issued by the United States State Department to be exported (given to a non-U.S. person).

The Department of State Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC) interprets and enforces ITAR.

Physical enforcement of the ITAR (as well as all import and export laws of the United States) is performed by Homeland Security Investigations Special Agents (formerly U.S. Customs) under Immigration and Customs Enforcement, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security.

ITAR does not apply to information related to general scientific, mathematical or engineering principles that are commonly taught in schools and colleges or information that is in the public domain.
