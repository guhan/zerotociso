# Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
A lightweight messaging protocol designed for reliable and efficient communication between devices, particularly in scenarios where bandwidth and resources may be limited. MQTT was developed by IBM in the late 1990s and has become widely adopted in the Internet of Things (IoT) and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. There are several reasons why MQTT is commonly used in these contexts


## Lightweight
MQTT is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for devices with limited processing power and memory. This makes it an ideal choice for IoT devices, which often have resource constraints.
## Publish/Subscribe Model
MQTT uses a publish/subscribe messaging model, allowing devices to subscribe to specific topics of interest and receive messages related to those topics. This decouples the sender (publisher) and the receiver (subscriber), enabling flexible communication patterns.
## Quality of Service (QoS)
MQTT supports different levels of message delivery quality, ranging from "At most once" (QoS 0) to "Exactly once" (QoS 2). This flexibility allows you to choose the appropriate level of reliability for your specific use case.
## Asynchronous Communication
MQTT operates asynchronously, allowing devices to send and receive messages independently of each other. This is valuable for scenarios where devices need to communicate without blocking or waiting for responses.
## Retained Messages
MQTT allows the broker to retain the last message sent on a specific topic, ensuring that newly subscribed devices receive the latest information when they connect.
## Last Will and Testament
MQTT provides a "Last Will and Testament" feature, which allows a device to specify a message to be sent by the broker in case the device unexpectedly disconnects. This can be used for error handling or cleanup procedures.
## Security
While MQTT itself does not define specific security mechanisms, it can be used in combination with various security protocols, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), to secure communications between devices and brokers.
## Scalability
MQTT brokers can be deployed in a scalable and distributed manner to handle a large number of devices and messages.
## Wide Adoption
MQTT has gained widespread adoption in the IoT and M2M domains, which means there are many client libraries and broker implementations available for various platforms and programming languages.
