# Lattice-based access control
Resources are classified and users are assigned different levels of security clearance or authorization. The lattice structure helps to model the hierarchy of security levels and the relationships between different levels. The access control decisions are then made based on this lattice structure.

## Lattice Structure
The lattice structure is established with a set of security levels organized in a hierarchical manner. Each level represents a certain level of access privilege, and relationships between levels are defined, such as "greater than" or "less than" relationships.
## Resource Classification
Resources (files, data, applications, etc.) are classified according to the security levels required to access them.
## User Clearance
Each user or user group is assigned a security clearance level. This level indicates the highest level of access they are allowed to have.
## Access Decision
When a user attempts to access a resource, the lattice-based access control system checks the user's clearance level against the security classification of the resource and the lattice structure. Access is granted if the user's clearance is at least as high as the required level for the resource, following the lattice relationships.
