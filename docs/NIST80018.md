# NIST 800-18: Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems
NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Special Publication 800-18, titled "Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems," provides guidance for federal agencies and organizations in the United States on developing comprehensive security plans for their information systems. These security plans are an essential part of the information security management process, helping organizations protect sensitive data and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their systems.

## Security Planning Process
The publication outlines a systematic process for developing security plans, including initiating the process, preparing and documenting the plan, and obtaining approval from the appropriate authorities.
## System Description
A security plan should begin with a detailed description of the information system it covers. This includes identifying the system's purpose, functionality, data processed, and its boundaries.
## Risk Assessment
Organizations are encouraged to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities associated with the information system. This information is used to make informed decisions about security controls.
## Security Control Selection
Based on the results of the risk assessment, organizations select appropriate security controls from NIST's Special Publication 800-53, "Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations," or other relevant sources.
## Control Implementation
The security plan should specify how the selected security controls will be implemented within the information system. This includes technical, administrative, and physical measures.
## Security Control Documentation
Organizations are required to document each security control's implementation details, including configuration settings, policies, procedures, and responsibilities.
## Security Roles and Responsibilities
The plan should define the roles and responsibilities of individuals and groups involved in the security management process, including system owners, security administrators, and users.
## Incident Response
The security plan should outline the procedures and responsibilities for responding to security incidents, including reporting, analysis, and mitigation.
## Continuous Monitoring
Organizations should describe how they will continuously monitor the effectiveness of security controls, including ongoing assessments, security testing, and vulnerability scanning.
## Plan Approval and Authorization
The security plan must be approved by appropriate authorities before the system is authorized for operation.
