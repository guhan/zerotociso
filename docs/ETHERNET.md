# Ethernet (802.3)
IEEE 802.3 is a set of standards that defines the physical and data link layers (Layer 1 and Layer 2) of the Ethernet networking technology. Ethernet is one of the most widely used LAN (Local Area Network) technologies, providing a method for devices to communicate over a shared network medium, such as copper cables (e.g., twisted pair) or optical fiber. IEEE 802.3 standards specify various aspects of Ethernet, including the framing, signaling, and electrical characteristics used for data transmission.

## Ethernet Frames
IEEE 802.3 defines the structure of Ethernet frames, which are the units of data transmitted over an Ethernet network. Frames include source and destination MAC (Media Access Control) addresses, frame type information, data payload, and error-checking information.

## CSMA/CD
Ethernet originally used a contention-based access method called Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD). In CSMA/CD, devices on the network listen for a clear channel before transmitting data to avoid collisions. While CSMA/CD was prevalent in early Ethernet networks, it is no longer used in modern Ethernet, as full-duplex communication and switches have largely eliminated collisions.

## Variants and Speeds
IEEE 802.3 standards cover various Ethernet variants, including 10BASE-T (10 Mbps over twisted pair), 100BASE-TX (100 Mbps over twisted pair), and Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbps or 1 Gbps). Additionally, standards for 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10 Gbps), 40 Gigabit Ethernet, and 100 Gigabit Ethernet have been developed.

## Auto-Negotiation
Ethernet devices often support auto-negotiation, which is a feature that allows devices to automatically determine and configure the best possible speed and duplex mode (half-duplex or full-duplex) for communication.

## Physical Layer Characteristics
IEEE 802.3 standards specify the physical layer characteristics, including cable types (e.g., Cat5e, Cat6), maximum cable lengths, and signaling methods (e.g., Manchester encoding, 4B/5B encoding).

## Ethernet Switching
Ethernet switching, which enables full-duplex communication and eliminates the need for CSMA/CD, is a fundamental part of modern Ethernet networks. Ethernet switches operate at Layer 2 (data link layer) and use MAC address tables to forward frames only to the appropriate destination devices.

## IEEE 802.3x Flow Control
IEEE 802.3x defines a flow control mechanism that allows Ethernet devices to signal each other to pause or resume data transmission to prevent network congestion and buffer overflows.

## Energy-Efficient Ethernet (EEE)
Some IEEE 802.3 standards incorporate energy-saving features to reduce power consumption in Ethernet devices during periods of low network activity.
