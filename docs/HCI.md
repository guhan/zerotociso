# Hyper Converged Infrastructure (HCI)
Hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) is a software-defined IT infrastructure that virtualizes all of the elements of conventional "hardware-defined" systems. HCI includes, at a minimum, virtualized computing (a hypervisor), software-defined storage, and virtualized networking (software-defined networking). HCI typically runs on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) servers.

The primary difference between converged infrastructure and hyperconverged infrastructure is that in HCI both the storage area network and the underlying storage abstractions are implemented virtually in software (at or via the hypervisor) rather than physically in hardware. Because software-defined elements are implemented in the context of the hypervisor, management of all resources can be federated (shared) across all instances of a hyper-converged infrastructure.

## Software-Defined
HCI relies on software to manage and control all the infrastructure components, making it highly flexible and adaptable. Software-defined storage and networking are central to HCI.
## Virtualization
Most HCI solutions utilize server virtualization, often powered by hypervisors like VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V, or open-source solutions like KVM.
## Integrated Hardware
HCI systems are typically sold as integrated appliances that include compute nodes, storage devices (often flash storage), and networking equipment. These are preconfigured to work seamlessly together.
## Scalability
HCI allows for easy scalability by adding additional nodes to the cluster as needed. This can be done with minimal disruption to ongoing operations.
## Centralized Management
HCI systems often come with a unified management interface that simplifies the administration of the entire infrastructure. This makes it easier to provision resources, monitor performance, and troubleshoot issues.
## Reduced Complexity
HCI reduces the need for complex, siloed hardware configurations and streamlines data center management. It's often seen as a more straightforward alternative to traditional three-tier architectures.
## High Availability
Many HCI solutions offer built-in redundancy and data protection features, which can improve the availability and reliability of applications and data.
## Data Efficiency
HCI often includes data reduction technologies like deduplication and compression, which help to optimize storage usage.
## Cost Savings
While the upfront cost of HCI systems can be high, organizations may realize cost savings in the long run due to reduced hardware and operational complexity.
## Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Integration
Some HCI solutions support hybrid and multi-cloud architectures, allowing organizations to seamlessly extend their infrastructure into public and private cloud environments.
