# AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)
AWS WAF, or Web Application Firewall, is a managed security service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps protect web applications from common web-based threats and attacks. It acts as a protective barrier between your web applications and the internet, allowing you to filter and control incoming web traffic to your applications, detect and block malicious requests, and improve the security of your applications.

## What are the benefits of using AWS WAF? 

- **Firewall Rules**: AWS WAF enables you to create rules that define how traffic to your web applications should be handled. You can specify conditions and actions to take for different types of requests, such as blocking, allowing, or counting requests.
- **Protection Against Common Threats**: AWS WAF helps protect against various types of web-based threats, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, and more.
- **Rate Limiting**: You can set up rate-based rules to limit the number of requests from a particular IP address or IP range within a specified time window, which can help mitigate brute-force attacks or other forms of abuse.
- **Geographic Filtering**: AWS WAF allows you to control access to your applications based on the geographic origin of the request, blocking traffic from specific countries or regions if desired.
- **Integration with Other AWS Services**: You can easily integrate AWS WAF with other AWS services like Amazon CloudFront (AWS's content delivery network), Amazon API Gateway, and Application Load Balancers to protect your applications deployed on AWS.
- **Managed Rules**: AWS offers a set of managed rule sets for AWS WAF that are designed to provide protection against common threats and attacks. These rule sets are regularly updated and can be easily integrated into your WAF configuration.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: AWS WAF provides logs and metrics to help you monitor and analyze web traffic, detect suspicious patterns, and gain insights into potential security threats.
- **Custom Rules**: You can create custom rules based on your specific application's needs, allowing you to tailor the security policies to your unique requirements.
- **Managed Rule Groups**: AWS WAF Managed Rule Groups are pre-configured rule sets that provide additional protection against common threats. These can simplify rule management and enhance security.
