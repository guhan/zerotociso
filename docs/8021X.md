# 802.1x
802.1X is a standard for port-based network access control (NAC) that provides an authentication framework for securing network access to Ethernet and Wi-Fi networks. It is a part of the IEEE 802.1 group of standards and is commonly used in enterprise environments to enhance network security.

## Authentication
802.1X provides a framework for authenticating users and devices before granting them access to a network. It allows for various authentication methods, including username/password, digital certificates, or other forms of authentication.

## Port-Based Control
802.1X operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) and controls access to network ports, such as Ethernet switch ports or Wi-Fi access points. When a device attempts to connect to a network port, that port is initially in a "closed" state, denying network access.

## Supplicant
The device seeking network access is referred to as the "supplicant." The supplicant initiates the authentication process by sending an authentication request to the network.

## Authenticator
The network entity (e.g., Ethernet switch or wireless access point) that controls access to the network port is called the "authenticator." It communicates with the supplicant and the authentication server to facilitate the authentication process.

## Authentication Server
The authentication server is responsible for validating the credentials provided by the supplicant. It can be an external server, such as a RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) server, or it can be integrated into the network infrastructure.

## EAP
Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is the primary authentication framework used with 802.1X. EAP allows for various authentication methods to be employed, including EAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security), EAP-PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol), EAP-MD5, and others.

## Three-Party Authentication
The 802.1X authentication process typically involves three parties: the supplicant, the authenticator, and the authentication server. The supplicant and authenticator exchange EAP messages, and the authenticator forwards these messages to the authentication server for validation.

## How does 802.1x authentication work?
The 802.1X authentication process can be summarized as follows:

- The supplicant initiates the connection and sends an EAPOL (EAP over LAN) Start message to the authenticator.
- The authenticator responds with an EAPOL Request message, prompting the supplicant to begin the authentication process.
- The supplicant sends its authentication credentials (e.g., username and password or digital certificate) to the authenticator in EAPOL Response messages.
- The authenticator relays the supplicant's credentials to the authentication server.
- The authentication server validates the credentials and responds to the authenticator, indicating whether access should be granted or denied.
- If access is granted, the authenticator places the network port in an "open" state, allowing data traffic to flow between the supplicant and the network.
