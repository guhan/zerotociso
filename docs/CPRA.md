# California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)
The CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act) is a privacy law in the state of California, United States. It builds upon and amends the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which was one of the first comprehensive state-level privacy laws in the U.S. The CPRA was passed as a ballot initiative in November 2020 and went into effect on January 1, 2023.

## Expanded Rights
It gives consumers more control over their personal data, including the ability to correct inaccurate information, limit the use of sensitive data, and opt-out of certain types of data processing.

Here are the key data subject rights under the CPRA:
- **Right to Know** California residents have the right to know what personal information businesses collect about them, the sources from which it was collected, the purposes for which it is used, and the categories of third parties with whom it is shared.
- **Right to Access** Consumers can request access to their personal information that businesses have collected. Businesses must provide this information in a readily usable format, such as a downloadable file.
- **Right to Deletion** Consumers have the right to request the deletion of their personal information. Upon receiving a valid deletion request, businesses are generally obligated to delete the requested information, subject to certain exceptions.
- **Right to Correct** Consumers can request the correction of inaccurate personal information that businesses hold about them. Businesses must take steps to verify the accuracy of the information and make corrections when necessary.
- **Right to Opt-Out of Sale** Consumers have the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. Businesses must provide a clear and conspicuous opt-out link on their websites for consumers to exercise this right.
- **Right to Opt-Out of Profiling for Certain Purposes** Consumers can opt-out of the use of their personal information for profiling that has legal or significant effects on them, such as for employment, credit, insurance, or housing purposes.
- **Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Personal Information** Consumers can limit the use and disclosure of their sensitive personal information, such as financial account numbers or health information, for purposes beyond what is necessary to fulfill the primary purposes for which it was collected.
- **Right to Data Portability** Consumers can request that businesses provide their personal information in a portable and usable format so that they can transfer it to another service provider.
- **Right to Non-Discrimination** Businesses are prohibited from discriminating against consumers who exercise their privacy rights. This means businesses cannot deny goods or services, charge different prices, or provide different levels of service based on a consumer's exercise of their privacy rights.
- **Right to Limit Data Collection for Minors** The CPRA introduces additional protections for minors. Businesses must obtain opt-in consent for the collection and sale of personal information of consumers under the age of 16, and parental consent for consumers under the age of 13.


## Establishment of the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA)
The CPRA created the CPPA, which is an independent agency responsible for enforcing and implementing privacy regulations in California. The CPPA takes over the enforcement role from the California Attorney General's office.
## Broader Definition of "Sensitive Personal Information"
The CPRA introduces a broader definition of sensitive personal information, including data such as precise geolocation, biometric information, and health information, requiring businesses to handle this data with additional care.

Under the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), "Sensitive Personal Information" is a specific category of personal data that receives heightened protection compared to other types of personal information. The CPRA defines Sensitive Personal Information as a subset of personal information and includes the following categories:
- **Social Security Numbers** Any part or whole of a Social Security number.
- **Driver's License Numbers, State Identification Card Numbers** Any part or whole of a driver's license number or state identification card number.
- **Account Numbers** Any financial account number, credit or debit card number, along with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to the associated account.
- **Precise Geolocation Data** Information that is precise enough to identify the specific location of an individual, such as GPS coordinates.
- **Racial or Ethnic Origin** Information that indicates an individual's racial or ethnic origin, including data derived from an individual's DNA.
- **Religious Beliefs** Information indicating an individual's religious beliefs or affiliations.
- **Union Membership** Information concerning an individual's membership in a labor union.
- **Biometric Information** Physiological, biological, or behavioral characteristics that can be used to establish individual identity. This includes fingerprints, retina scans, voiceprints, and facial recognition data.
- **Health Information** Information related to an individual's physical or mental health, including health records, medical conditions, genetic data, and health insurance information.
- **Sexual Orientation** Information indicating an individual's sexual orientation.
- **Sexual Activity** Information related to an individual's sexual activities or sexual orientation.

## Data Retention Limits
The California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) does not specify specific data retention limits or timeframes for how long businesses should retain personal information. Instead, the CPRA focuses on principles related to data minimization and purpose limitation, which guide businesses in determining how long they should retain personal information.

- **Data Minimization** The CPRA emphasizes the principle of data minimization, which means that businesses should only collect and retain personal information that is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. In other words, businesses should not collect more data than they need.
- **Purpose Limitation** Businesses should only retain personal information for the specific purposes for which it was collected or for compatible purposes that the consumer would reasonably expect. Once the personal information is no longer needed for those purposes, it should be deleted.
- **Consumer Rights** The CPRA grants consumers the right to request the deletion of their personal information. Upon receiving a valid deletion request, businesses are generally obligated to delete the requested information, subject to certain exceptions.
- **Sensitive Personal Information** The CPRA places additional restrictions on the retention of sensitive personal information, such as financial account numbers or health information. Businesses are required to specify the length of time they will retain sensitive personal information or the criteria used to determine retention periods in their privacy policies.
- **Data Retention Policies** Businesses subject to the CPRA are required to establish and disclose data retention policies as part of their privacy policies. These policies should provide consumers with information about how long different categories of personal information will be retained.
- **Data Protection Measures** Businesses should implement reasonable security measures to protect personal information, including data that is retained. Data that is no longer needed for the specified purposes should be securely disposed of to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

## Annual Risk Assessments
Businesses that process a significant amount of personal information must conduct annual risk assessments of their data processing activities and privacy practices.

- **Identification of Data Processing Activities** Businesses must identify and document all the data processing activities they engage in. This includes collecting, using, sharing, and retaining personal information.
- **Purposes of Data Processing** For each processing activity, businesses must specify the purposes for which personal information is collected and processed. These purposes should be consistent with what was disclosed to consumers when the data was collected.
- **Data Minimization** Businesses should assess whether they are collecting and retaining only the personal information that is necessary for the specified purposes. The principle of data minimization encourages businesses to limit the amount of personal information they collect and retain.
- **Data Security Measures** The risk assessment should include an evaluation of the security measures in place to protect personal information. This includes assessing whether the security measures are appropriate and effective in safeguarding data against unauthorized access or breaches.
- **Data Retention Periods** The assessment should consider the retention periods for different categories of personal information. Businesses should ensure that data is not retained longer than necessary for the purposes for which it was collected.
- **Consumer Rights Compliance** Businesses should assess their compliance with consumer rights, such as the right to access, delete, and correct personal information, as well as the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information.
- **Sensitive Personal Information** If the business processes sensitive personal information, it should evaluate how this data is handled and whether it is subject to heightened security measures and restrictions.
- **Third-Party Data Processors** If the business shares personal information with third-party service providers or processors, it should assess the contractual agreements and security measures in place to protect the data when it is in the hands of third parties.
- **Documentation** The results of the risk assessment should be documented, including any remediation actions taken to address identified risks or compliance gaps.
- **Regular Review** Businesses should conduct these risk assessments on an annual basis to ensure ongoing compliance with the CPRA's requirements and to adapt to changes in data processing activities or risks.
## Contractual Requirements for Data Processors
The CPRA introduces specific contractual requirements for data processors to ensure that they handle personal information in compliance with the law.

- **Written Agreements** Data processors must enter into written agreements with the businesses that hire them (referred to as "businesses" or "data controllers"). These agreements must outline the data processor's responsibilities and obligations regarding the processing of personal information on behalf of the data controller.
- **Limited Processing** Data processors are only permitted to process personal information on behalf of the data controller for the specific purposes specified in the written agreement. Any additional processing of personal information must be authorized by the data controller.
- **Confidentiality** Data processors must maintain the confidentiality of personal information and ensure that their employees and subcontractors also adhere to strict confidentiality requirements.
- **Security Measures** Data processors are required to implement and maintain reasonable security measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
- **Data Deletion** Data processors must assist data controllers in fulfilling consumer requests for data deletion. This includes the prompt deletion of personal information when instructed to do so by the data controller.
- **Data Access** Data processors must assist data controllers in responding to consumer requests for access to their personal information. This involves providing the data controller with the necessary information to fulfill these requests.
- **Data Portability** Data processors must assist data controllers in providing consumers with their personal information in a portable format upon request.
- **Audit and Assessment** Data processors may be subject to audits and assessments by the data controller or the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) to verify compliance with the CPRA's requirements.
- **Subcontractor Requirements** Data processors must obtain the data controller's consent before engaging subcontractors to process personal information on their behalf. When subcontractors are used, the data processor remains responsible for ensuring that they comply with CPRA requirements.
- **Cooperation in Investigations** Data processors are required to cooperate with investigations and inquiries conducted by the CPPA.
- **Data Breach Notification** Data processors must notify data controllers promptly in the event of a data breach.

## Enhanced Penalties
The CPRA increases penalties for violations, particularly for the mishandling of children's personal information.

- **Administrative Fines** The CPRA authorizes the newly established California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) to impose administrative fines on businesses for certain violations of the law. These fines can be substantial and are intended to incentivize compliance. The maximum administrative fine for each violation of the CPRA is**
  - **Up to $2,500 for violations involving consumers under the age of 16.
  - **Up to $7,500 for violations involving consumers under the age of 13.
- **Intentional Violations** The CPRA imposes higher penalties for intentional violations of the law. If a business intentionally violates the CPRA's provisions, it may face civil penalties of up to $7,500 per violation.
- **Data Breach Penalties** The CPRA introduces additional penalties for businesses that suffer data breaches due to their failure to implement reasonable security measures to protect personal information. If the CPPA determines that a business failed to implement reasonable security and this failure contributed to a data breach, the business can be fined up to $2,500 per violation or $7,500 per intentional violation.
- **Class Action Lawsuits** The CPRA also provides for a private right of action for consumers in the event of certain data breaches involving non-encrypted and non-redacted personal information. In such cases, consumers can seek statutory damages ranging from $100 to $750 per consumer per incident, or actual damages if they are greater.
