# California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)
The CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act) is a privacy law in the state of California, United States. It builds upon and amends the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which was one of the first comprehensive state-level privacy laws in the U.S. The CPRA was passed as a ballot initiative in November 2020 and went into effect on January 1, 2023.

## Expanded Rights
It gives consumers more control over their personal data, including the ability to correct inaccurate information, limit the use of sensitive data, and opt-out of certain types of data processing.
## Establishment of the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA)
The CPRA created the CPPA, which is an independent agency responsible for enforcing and implementing privacy regulations in California. The CPPA takes over the enforcement role from the California Attorney General's office.
## Broader Definition of "Sensitive Personal Information"
The CPRA introduces a broader definition of sensitive personal information, including data such as precise geolocation, biometric information, and health information, requiring businesses to handle this data with additional care.

Under the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), "Sensitive Personal Information" is a specific category of personal data that receives heightened protection compared to other types of personal information. The CPRA defines Sensitive Personal Information as a subset of personal information and includes the following categories:
- **Social Security Numbers** Any part or whole of a Social Security number.
- **Driver's License Numbers, State Identification Card Numbers** Any part or whole of a driver's license number or state identification card number.
- **Account Numbers** Any financial account number, credit or debit card number, along with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to the associated account.
- **Precise Geolocation Data** Information that is precise enough to identify the specific location of an individual, such as GPS coordinates.
- **Racial or Ethnic Origin** Information that indicates an individual's racial or ethnic origin, including data derived from an individual's DNA.
- **Religious Beliefs** Information indicating an individual's religious beliefs or affiliations.
- **Union Membership** Information concerning an individual's membership in a labor union.
- **Biometric Information** Physiological, biological, or behavioral characteristics that can be used to establish individual identity. This includes fingerprints, retina scans, voiceprints, and facial recognition data.
- **Health Information** Information related to an individual's physical or mental health, including health records, medical conditions, genetic data, and health insurance information.
- **Sexual Orientation** Information indicating an individual's sexual orientation.
- **Sexual Activity** Information related to an individual's sexual activities or sexual orientation.

## Data Retention Limits
It imposes limits on how long businesses can retain personal information and requires them to specify their data retention policies.
## Annual Risk Assessments
Businesses that process a significant amount of personal information must conduct annual risk assessments of their data processing activities and privacy practices.
## Contractual Requirements for Data Processors
The CPRA introduces specific contractual requirements for data processors to ensure that they handle personal information in compliance with the law.
## Enhanced Penalties
The CPRA increases penalties for violations, particularly for the mishandling of children's personal information.

- **Administrative Fines** The CPRA authorizes the newly established California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) to impose administrative fines on businesses for certain violations of the law. These fines can be substantial and are intended to incentivize compliance. The maximum administrative fine for each violation of the CPRA is**
- **Up to $2,500 for violations involving consumers under the age of 16.
- **Up to $7,500 for violations involving consumers under the age of 13.
- **Intentional Violations** The CPRA imposes higher penalties for intentional violations of the law. If a business intentionally violates the CPRA's provisions, it may face civil penalties of up to $7,500 per violation.
- **Data Breach Penalties** The CPRA introduces additional penalties for businesses that suffer data breaches due to their failure to implement reasonable security measures to protect personal information. If the CPPA determines that a business failed to implement reasonable security and this failure contributed to a data breach, the business can be fined up to $2,500 per violation or $7,500 per intentional violation.
- **Class Action Lawsuits** The CPRA also provides for a private right of action for consumers in the event of certain data breaches involving non-encrypted and non-redacted personal information. In such cases, consumers can seek statutory damages ranging from $100 to $750 per consumer per incident, or actual damages if they are greater.
## Additional Consumer Rights
The law grants consumers the right to opt-out of the sharing of their personal information for behavioral advertising and profiling purposes.

Here are the key data subject rights under the CPRA:
- **Right to Know** California residents have the right to know what personal information businesses collect about them, the sources from which it was collected, the purposes for which it is used, and the categories of third parties with whom it is shared.
- **Right to Access** Consumers can request access to their personal information that businesses have collected. Businesses must provide this information in a readily usable format, such as a downloadable file.
- **Right to Deletion** Consumers have the right to request the deletion of their personal information. Upon receiving a valid deletion request, businesses are generally obligated to delete the requested information, subject to certain exceptions.
- **Right to Correct** Consumers can request the correction of inaccurate personal information that businesses hold about them. Businesses must take steps to verify the accuracy of the information and make corrections when necessary.
- **Right to Opt-Out of Sale** Consumers have the right to opt-out of the sale of their personal information. Businesses must provide a clear and conspicuous opt-out link on their websites for consumers to exercise this right.
