## ISC Code of Ethics

Ethics that outlines the ethical principles and standards expected of its certified information 
security professionals, particularly those who hold the Certified Information Systems Security 
Professional (CISSP) certification. The ISC Code of Ethics is designed to guide professionals 
in the field of information security to make ethical and responsible decisions in their work. 

Here is a summary of the key principles in the ISC Code of Ethics:

- **Protect Society, the Common Good, Necessary Public Trust, and the Infrastructure**: Security professionals are expected to act in a manner that promotes the best interests of society as a whole. They should work to protect the public, the infrastructure, and the trust that society places in information security professionals.
