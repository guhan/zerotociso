# Diddling Attack
A diddling attack, also known as data diddling or data manipulation, is a form of cyberattack or fraudulent activity in which an **attacker alters data or records to manipulate information for personal gain** or to harm an organization or individual. Diddling attacks typically involve unauthorized or fraudulent changes to data in a way that benefits the attacker.

## Data Manipulation
In a diddling attack, the attacker intentionally modifies data, records, or transactions. This manipulation can take various forms, such as altering financial records, changing inventory levels, or modifying customer information.
## Financial Gain
Diddling attacks are often motivated by financial gain. Attackers may manipulate data to steal money or assets, embezzle funds, or commit fraud.
## Insider Threat
Diddling attacks are sometimes carried out by individuals with insider access to an organization's systems or data. This could include employees, contractors, or trusted third parties.
## Subtle Changes
The changes made in a diddling attack are often subtle and go unnoticed for some time. This allows the attacker to continue the fraudulent activity without raising suspicion.
## Impact on Trust
Diddling attacks can have a significant impact on trust and confidence in an organization. When customers or stakeholders discover that data has been manipulated, it can erode trust and damage an organization's reputation.
## Detection Challenges
Detecting diddling attacks can be challenging because the changes made to data may not trigger immediate alarms or raise suspicion. Effective monitoring and auditing processes are necessary to identify such attacks.
