# Stored Procedures
A stored procedure is a precompiled and reusable set of one or more SQL statements or procedural logic that is stored in a database management system (DBMS). Stored procedures are typically used to perform specific tasks or operations within a database. They offer several advantages, including improved performance, security, and code organization. 

## Precompiled and Cached
Stored procedures are precompiled and stored in the database. This means that the execution plan for a stored procedure is created and cached, which can lead to improved query performance because the database doesn't need to recompile the SQL statements each time they are executed.
## Parameterized
Stored procedures can accept input parameters, which allow you to create flexible and reusable code. Parameters make it possible to pass values into the procedure when it is executed, enabling dynamic queries and operations.
## Security
Stored procedures can enhance security by controlling access to database objects. Database administrators can grant or restrict permissions to execute specific stored procedures, limiting what users or applications can do within the database.
## Modularity
They promote code modularity and organization. By encapsulating logic within stored procedures, you can separate business logic from the application code. This makes it easier to maintain and update database-related operations.
## Reduced Network Traffic
When applications use stored procedures, they can send calls to the database server with just the procedure name and parameters, reducing the amount of data transferred over the network. This can be beneficial in scenarios with limited bandwidth.
## Transaction Management
Stored procedures can be used to manage transactions. You can define multiple SQL statements within a single stored procedure and ensure that they are executed atomically, either all succeeding or all failing together.
## Code Reusability
Once defined, stored procedures can be reused by multiple applications or parts of an application. This promotes code consistency and reduces redundancy.
## Version Control
Changes to a stored procedure can be versioned and managed separately from application code, simplifying the process of tracking and deploying database changes.
## Error Handling
You can implement custom error handling and exception management within stored procedures, making it possible to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to users or applications.
