# Ping Flood (ICMP Flood)
In a ping flood attack, an attacker sends a massive number of ICMP echo request (ping) packets to a target host. The target becomes overwhelmed, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Tools like "ping" can be used for legitimate network diagnostics but can also be abused for this type of attack.
