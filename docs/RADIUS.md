## RADIUS


## How does RADIUS work?
Here's how RADIUS works:

- **Client Authentication Request**: When a user attempts to connect to a network resource, such as accessing the internet through a Wi-Fi network, the network access server (NAS) acting as a RADIUS client sends an authentication request to the RADIUS server.


- **RADIUS Server Authentication**: The RADIUS server receives the authentication request and verifies the user's credentials. The server can use various methods to authenticate the user, such as username and password, digital certificates, token-based authentication, or other authentication mechanisms.


- **Authentication Response**: After validating the user's credentials, the RADIUS server sends an authentication response to the RADIUS client. The response can be "Access Accept" if the authentication is successful or "Access Reject" if the authentication fails.


- **Authorization and Accounting**: If the authentication is successful, the RADIUS server can also provide authorization information to the RADIUS client, specifying the user's access privileges and restrictions. Additionally, RADIUS supports accounting functionality, allowing the server to log and track network resource usage, such as session duration, data transferred, and other relevant information.

Key features and benefits of RADIUS include:
- **Centralized Authentication**: RADIUS enables centralized user authentication and eliminates the need for separate authentication systems in different network access points. This simplifies the management of user credentials and improves security.
- **Scalability**: RADIUS is scalable and can handle a large number of users and network access points. It allows organizations to efficiently manage authentication and authorization for a large user base and multiple network devices.
- **Standardization**: RADIUS is an industry-standard protocol, ensuring interoperability and compatibility between different networking vendors and devices. This facilitates the deployment and integration of RADIUS in various network environments.
- **Accounting and Auditing**: RADIUS provides accounting functionality, allowing organizations to monitor and track network resource usage. This data can be used for auditing, billing, or troubleshooting purposes.
