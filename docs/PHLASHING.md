# Phlashing
"Phlashing" is a malicious cyberattack that aims to permanently disable or "brick" a piece of hardware, such as a computer, smartphone, router, or other electronic device. The term "phlashing" is a portmanteau of "phreaking" (a term used in the past to describe hacking into telecommunications systems) and "flashing" (the process of updating firmware or software on a device).

Phlashing attacks typically involve manipulating or overwriting the firmware or software that controls the hardware's essential functions. Unlike some other cyberattacks that may steal data or disrupt operations temporarily, phlashing is intended to cause permanent damage to the device. This can render the device unusable, even after attempts to recover or repair it.

Phlashing attacks can be highly destructive and are often carried out by individuals with malicious intent, seeking to cause significant financial or operational damage to individuals, organizations, or critical infrastructure.
