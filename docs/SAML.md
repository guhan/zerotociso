# OASIS Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

OASIS Open is a community where experts can advance projects, including open source projects, for cybersecurity, blockchain, IoT, emergency management, cloud computing, and legal data exchange.

SAML is a standard that defines a framework for exchanging security information between online business partners. Developed by the Security Services Technical Committee, SAML is an XML-based framework that supports business communications for user authentication, entitlement, and attribute information. Organizations can apply it to human and machine entities, partner companies, or other enterprise applications. Organizations most often use SAML for web single-sign-on (SSO), attribute-based authorization, and securing web services.

SAML consists of four main components:
1. Assertions: Information that includes authentication, attribute, and authorization decisions
2. Protocols: Request/response protocols that help identity providers manage user requests to resources
3. Bindings: Mappings of request-response message exchanges to standard messaging or communication protocols
4. Profiles: Definitions that show how SAML can be used within a particular application as a way to promote interoperability
