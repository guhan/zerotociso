# BSA
A U.S. federal law enacted in 1970 to combat money laundering and other financial crimes, including terrorist financing. The primary objective of the BSA is to prevent criminals from using financial institutions to conceal and transfer illicit funds.

### Key provisions and requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act include:

- Currency Transaction Reporting (CTR): Financial institutions, including banks and credit unions, are **required to report cash transactions of $10,000 or more** conducted by individuals or businesses in a single day. The purpose of CTRs is to track large cash transactions that might be indicative of money laundering or other illegal activities.
- Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR): Financial institutions are mandated to report any suspicious transactions or activities that may indicate money laundering, terrorist financing, or other illegal activities. The SAR process enables financial institutions to alert law enforcement authorities to potential suspicious behavior.
- Recordkeeping: Financial institutions must maintain records of various transactions, including CTRs and SARs, as well as account records and customer identification information, to facilitate compliance and aid in investigations.
- Customer Identification Program (CIP): Financial institutions are required to **establish and maintain a program to verify and record the identity of customers opening accounts**. The CIP helps prevent anonymous accounts that could be used for illicit purposes. Also referred to as **KYC - know your customer**. 
- Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Programs: Financial institutions are required to develop and implement comprehensive AML programs designed to detect and prevent money laundering and other financial crimes. These programs must include policies, procedures, and training for employees.
- Foreign Bank Account Reporting (FBAR): U.S. persons with financial interest or signature authority over foreign financial accounts exceeding certain thresholds must report these accounts to the U.S. Treasury annually.
- Information Sharing: The BSA encourages cooperation and information sharing between financial institutions and government agencies, such as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and law enforcement.
