# RAID

## RAID
RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) levels are different configurations in which multiple 
hard drives are combined to achieve various goals, such as increased data redundancy, improved 
performance, or a combination of both. There are several RAID levels, each with its own 
characteristics and benefits. Here are some of the most common RAID levels:

- **RAID 0 (Striping)**:
  - Data is striped across multiple disks.
  - Offers improved performance by spreading data across disks, but there's no redundancy.
  - No data protection; if one disk fails, all data is lost.
- **RAID 1 (Mirroring)**:
  - Data is duplicated on two or more disks.
  - Provides data redundancy, as each disk contains the same data.
  - Offers fault tolerance; if one disk fails, data is still accessible from the other disk(s).
- **RAID 5 (Striping with Parity)**:
  - Data is striped across multiple disks, and parity information is distributed.
  - Provides good balance between performance and redundancy.
  - Requires a minimum of three disks; can tolerate a single disk failure without data loss.
- **RAID 6 (Striping with Double Parity)**:
  - Similar to RAID 5, but with an additional parity disk.
  - Can tolerate the failure of two disks simultaneously without data loss.
  - Offers higher data redundancy but may have slightly lower write performance compared to RAID 5.
- **RAID 10 (RAID 1+0 or Mirrored Stripes)**:
  - Combines elements of RAID 1 and RAID 0.
  - Data is both mirrored and striped across disks.
  - Provides excellent performance and fault tolerance.
  - Requires a minimum of four disks; can tolerate multiple disk failures depending on the location of the failed disks.
- **RAID 50 (RAID 5+0 or Striped Parity)**:
  - Combines elements of RAID 5 and RAID 0.
  - Data is striped across RAID 5 arrays (sets of disks) for performance and redundancy.
  - Requires a minimum of six disks and offers good performance and fault tolerance.
- **RAID 60 (RAID 6+0 or Striped Double Parity)**:
  - Combines elements of RAID 6 and RAID 0.
  - Data is striped across RAID 6 arrays for higher performance and redundancy.
  - Requires a minimum of eight disks and provides excellent fault tolerance.
- **RAID 1E (Mirrored Stripes)**:
  - Combines elements of RAID 1 and RAID 0.
  - Data is mirrored and striped across pairs of disks.
  - Offers redundancy and performance but requires at least four disks.
- **RAID JBOD (Just a Bunch of Disks)**:
  - Not a true RAID level; disks are presented to the system as individual units.
  - Used when no RAID features are needed, or when a mix of disks is required.
