# Mutation Testing
Mutation testing is a software testing technique used to evaluate the effectiveness of a test suite by introducing small, deliberate changes (mutations) into the codebase and determining whether the test suite can detect and report these changes. The primary goal of mutation testing is to assess the quality and fault-detection capabilities of the test suite by measuring its ability to identify potential defects or "mutants" in the code.

## What are the benefits of mutation testing? 
- **Test Suite Effectiveness**: It reveals the adequacy and thoroughness of the test suite. A low mutation score suggests that the test suite may be inadequate in detecting potential defects.
- **Code Quality Improvement**: Developers can use mutation testing results to identify areas of the code that are not well-covered by tests and improve test cases accordingly.
- **Bug Detection**: Mutation testing may uncover latent bugs or vulnerabilities in the code that were not previously identified through other testing techniques.

## How does mutation testing work?

- **Mutant Generation**: The first step in mutation testing is to generate mutants. Mutants are created by applying small, predefined code modifications to the original source code. These modifications are designed to simulate common programming errors, such as introducing a logical operator error, changing a variable assignment, or modifying conditional statements. Each mutant represents a potential defect in the code.
- **Test Suite Execution**: The test suite, consisting of a set of test cases, is executed against both the original, unmodified code (the "baseline") and each mutant. The goal is to determine whether the test cases can detect differences in behavior between the original code and the mutants.
- **Mutation Analysis**: For each mutant, the mutation testing tool analyzes the test suite's results to determine whether the mutant was killed (detected) or survived (not detected). A mutant is considered "killed" if the test suite produces a failed test case or reports an error related to that mutant. A mutant is considered "survived" if the test suite passes all test cases despite the mutant's presence.
- **Mutation Score**: The mutation score is a metric used to evaluate the effectiveness of the test suite. It is calculated as the ratio of killed mutants to the total number of mutants. A higher mutation score indicates a more effective test suite because it means that a larger proportion of potential defects (mutants) were detected.
