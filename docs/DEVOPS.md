# DevOps
DevOps is a set a processes that enable an organization to produce reliable, scalable, and robust products. 

## Useful Metrics to track
The following metrics are good to track to assess the maturity of the DevOps practices at an organization. Ideally, there should be a 
dashboard tracking these metrics over time visible by all members of the organization. 

### Lead Time for changes
How long does it take from idea to production for a change? 

### MTTR
When a system is not performing as desired how long does it take for the organization to push changes to recover. 

### Frequency of releases
How often is the production environment updated? 


### Change failure Rate
What percentage of the changes pushed cause further issues? 

### Reliability 
This metric is broken down into:
- uptime: percentage of time over a given period that the services are available
- error rate: percentage of requests that result in an error (caught or uncaught)
