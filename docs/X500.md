# X.500
X.500 is a series of international standards that define a directory services model for managing and organizing information about users, devices, resources, and other objects within a network or organization. It provides a structured and hierarchical way to store and retrieve information, making it easier to manage and access directory data.

## Directory Service
X.500 defines a directory service, which is a centralized and hierarchical database of information about entities within an organization. These entities can include users, devices, departments, email addresses, and more.

## Hierarchical Structure
X.500 directories are organized hierarchically, similar to a tree or a file system. At the top of the hierarchy is the "Directory Information Tree" (DIT), which represents the entire directory. Below the DIT are various "entries" or objects that represent individual entities or resources.

## Distinguished Names (DNs)
Each entry in the directory is uniquely identified by a Distinguished Name (DN). A DN is a sequence of names that specifies the entry's location within the directory's hierarchy. For example, a user's DN might be "cn=John Doe, ou=Users, dc=example, dc=com," where "cn" stands for "common name," "ou" stands for "organizational unit," and "dc" stands for "domain component."

## Attributes
Entries in the directory can have attributes associated with them. Attributes are pieces of information about the entry, such as name, email address, phone number, or group membership. Each attribute has a type and one or more values.

## Standard Protocols
X.500 includes standard protocols for accessing and manipulating directory data, such as Directory Access Protocol (DAP) and Directory System Protocol (DSP).

## Security
X.500 directories support authentication and access control mechanisms to protect directory data from unauthorized access.

## Interoperability 
X.500 was designed to be an international standard for directory services. However, it is relatively complex and has not seen widespread adoption outside certain specific use cases.

## LDAP
The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is a simplified and widely adopted protocol inspired by X.500. LDAP is often used for directory services and is more lightweight and practical for many applications.
