# Linux
Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel that serves as the core component of various Linux-based operating systems (often referred to as Linux distributions or "distros"). It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 and has since become one of the most widely used operating system kernels in the world. Linux is known for its stability, security, flexibility, and the vibrant open-source community that surrounds it.

## Open Source
Linux is distributed under open-source licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL), which means that its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This open-source nature has led to a vast and active community of developers and users contributing to its development and improvement.
## Unix-Like
Linux is designed to be compatible with the Unix operating system and follows many Unix principles and conventions. This includes a hierarchical file system, a command-line interface with a rich set of commands, and a multi-user, multi-tasking environment.
## Modularity
The Linux kernel is highly modular, allowing for the addition and removal of kernel modules to extend or modify the kernel's functionality without the need for a complete kernel recompilation.
## Hardware Compatibility
Linux has excellent hardware compatibility and supports a wide range of computer architectures, from embedded systems and smartphones to servers and supercomputers.
## Security
Linux is known for its robust security features, including user and group-based access control, file permissions, and support for security-enhancing technologies like [SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)](SELINUX.md) and [AppArmor](APPARMOR.md).
## Package Management
Most Linux distributions use package managers to simplify the installation, removal, and updating of software packages. Common package managers include APT (Debian/Ubuntu), YUM/DNF (Fedora/CentOS), and Pacman (Arch Linux).
## Variety of Distributions
There are hundreds of Linux distributions, each with its own package selection, configuration, and target audience. Popular distributions include Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Debian, openSUSE, and Arch Linux, among others.
## Command-Line Interface
Linux provides a powerful command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the system and execute commands. The Bash shell is one of the most widely used Linux shells.
## Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)
While Linux is often associated with the command line, it also offers a range of graphical user interfaces (e.g., GNOME, KDE, Xfce) that provide a familiar desktop environment for users who prefer GUIs.
## Server and Desktop Use
Linux is widely used in both server and desktop environments. It powers a significant portion of web servers, cloud infrastructure, and embedded systems. It also serves as the basis for many desktop operating systems, including Ubuntu and Fedora.
