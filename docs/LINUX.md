## Runlevels
- **Runlevel 0**: Halt or shutdown mode. 
- **Runlevel 1**: Single-user mode. The system starts with minimal services, usually allowing only the root user to log in. It is used for maintenance tasks and troubleshooting.
- **Runlevel 2**: Multi-user mode with _no networking_. This runlevel provides a text-based multi-user environment with minimal services and no networking.
- **Runlevel 3**: Multi-user mode with networking. This runlevel is similar to runlevel 2 but includes networking support, allowing multiple users to log in and use network services.
- **Runlevel 4**: Not used by default. Administrators can define its purpose if needed.
- **Runlevel 6**: Reboot mode.
