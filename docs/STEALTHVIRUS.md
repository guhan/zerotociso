# Stealth Virus
A stealth virus is a type of computer virus that is designed to hide its presence and avoid detection by traditional antivirus software and security mechanisms. Unlike more straightforward viruses that may announce their presence or exhibit obvious and disruptive behavior, stealth viruses are specifically crafted to remain covert within an infected system for extended periods.

## Concealment
Stealth viruses use various techniques to conceal their presence within the host system. This may involve encrypting or obfuscating their code, modifying file attributes, or manipulating system data structures to avoid detection.
## Stealth Mechanisms
These viruses often employ stealth mechanisms to avoid triggering suspicion. This may include intercepting and modifying system calls or memory operations that antivirus programs rely on for scanning.
## Polymorphism
Some stealth viruses use polymorphic code, which means they can change their appearance each time they infect a new host. This makes it challenging for signature-based antivirus solutions to identify and remove them.
## Rootkit Capabilities
In some cases, stealth viruses incorporate rootkit-like functionality, allowing them to manipulate the operating system's core functions and hide their presence from both the user and security software.
## Persistent Infection
Stealth viruses typically aim for long-term persistence within the infected system. They may attach themselves to system files, drivers, or the boot sector of a disk to ensure they are loaded into memory each time the system starts.
## Payloads
While the primary focus of stealth viruses is to avoid detection, they may also contain malicious payloads or routines that can cause damage to the system or steal sensitive information once activated.
## Slow Spreading
To avoid raising suspicion, stealth viruses often spread slowly and selectively, infecting only a limited number of files or systems over time.
