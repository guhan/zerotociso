# State Machine Model
System is always secure no matter what state it is in
- Always boots into a secure state

## Formal State Machine (aka State Machine or finite-state machine) 
is a mathematical model used to describe the behavior of systems that can exist in a finite number of 
distinct states and transition between those states based on certain inputs or events. State machines are 
commonly used in computer science, engineering, and various other fields to model and analyze 
systems with discrete and sequential behavior.

A formal state machine consists of the following components:

- States: These are distinct conditions or situations that a system can be in. Each state represents a specific configuration or mode of operation for the system.
- Transitions: Transitions define the way the system changes from one state to another in response to inputs, events, or conditions. Transitions are triggered by certain events or conditions, and they dictate how the system's state changes.
- Inputs/Events: These are external factors that influence the state transitions. Events trigger the state transitions, and the behavior of the system depends on which event occurs.
- Outputs/Actions: Outputs or actions are the consequences or responses of the system to the state transitions. These can include changes in the system's behavior, updates to data, or interactions with the environment.
