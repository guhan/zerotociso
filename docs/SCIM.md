# System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)
SCIM stands for System for Cross-domain Identity Management. It is an open standard protocol designed for **managing user identities and resources across different systems and domains**.

The primary goal of SCIM is to provide a standardized approach to user and group management

- Resources: SCIM defines a set of resource types, such as User and Group, which represent entities and their associated attributes (e.g., username, email, roles, etc.). Resources are represented using JSON or XML formats.


- API Endpoints: SCIM provides standard API endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving resources. These endpoints follow the principles of RESTful architecture and support common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).


- Schemas: SCIM uses schemas to define the structure and attributes of resources. Schemas specify the allowed attributes, their data types, and any validation rules. They help ensure interoperability and consistent data representation across different systems.
Filtering and Paging: SCIM allows filtering and paging of resources, enabling clients to retrieve a subset of resources based on specific criteria and paginate through large result sets.
- Bulk Operations: SCIM supports bulk operations, which allow clients to perform multiple create, update, or delete operations in a single request. This helps optimize performance and reduce network overhead when dealing with a large number of resources.
- Security: SCIM provides mechanisms for authentication and authorization, allowing secure access to the API endpoints. It supports various authentication methods, including OAuth, HTTP Basic Authentication, and more.
