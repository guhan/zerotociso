# HTTP Request Smuggling
HTTP request smuggling is a web security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker manipulates the interpretation of HTTP requests by a front-end and back-end server in a way that allows the attacker to perform malicious actions, such as bypassing security mechanisms, stealing sensitive data, or executing unauthorized actions on a web application. This vulnerability typically arises due to discrepancies in how different web servers and proxies handle certain aspects of HTTP requests, such as content length and request headers.

Here's a simplified overview of how HTTP request smuggling works:

- **Front-End and Back-End Servers**: In many web architectures, a front-end server (e.g., a load balancer or proxy) receives incoming HTTP requests from clients and forwards them to one or more back-end servers (e.g., application servers).
- **Differences in Parsing**: Front-end and back-end servers may have differences in how they parse and interpret certain HTTP request headers, content length, or encoding. These differences can be exploited by an attacker.
- **Malicious Requests**: The attacker sends carefully crafted, ambiguous HTTP requests to the front-end server. These requests are designed to be interpreted differently by the front-end and back-end servers.
- **Discrepancy Exploitation**: The attacker's goal is to exploit the discrepancy in interpretation. For example, they may trick the front-end server into forwarding a request with an incomplete content length to the back-end server, but the back-end server processes it as if it were complete.
- **Attack Outcomes**: Depending on the specific vulnerability and its exploitation, various outcomes are possible, such as bypassing security controls, causing cache poisoning, stealing user data, or performing actions on behalf of the victim.


## How to prevent request smuggling?
To prevent HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities, it's important to:

- Keep all software components (front-end servers, back-end servers, proxies) up to date to minimize the risk of discrepancies.
- Configure servers and proxies to consistently interpret and enforce HTTP standards.
- Use security tools and practices, such as web application firewalls (WAFs), to detect and mitigate potential HTTP request smuggling attacks.
- Implement secure coding practices in your web applications to minimize the impact of successful attacks.
