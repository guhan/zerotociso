# Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
It is a category of cybersecurity technology and a key component of modern cybersecurity strategies. EDR solutions are designed to help organizations detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents and threats on individual endpoints, such as desktop computers, laptops, servers, and mobile devices.

## Real-time Monitoring
EDR solutions continuously monitor endpoint devices for suspicious activities and potential security threats.
## Threat Detection
They use various methods, including behavioral analysis, anomaly detection, and signature-based detection, to identify malicious activities and potential security breaches.
## Incident Investigation
EDR tools provide detailed information about security incidents, allowing security teams to investigate the scope and impact of an incident.
## Threat Hunting
Security professionals can proactively search for signs of threats and vulnerabilities on endpoints.
## Response and Remediation
EDR solutions enable security teams to take action to contain and mitigate security incidents. This may include isolating an infected device, removing malware, and applying patches or updates.
## Forensics and Data Collection
EDR tools often provide data and logs that can be used for forensic analysis and compliance reporting.
## Reporting and Alerting
They generate alerts and reports to inform security teams about potential security events and incidents.
