# Single Sign On (SSO)



## Central Authentication Service (CAS)
CAS is often used as an abbreviation for the "Central Authentication Service," which is a single sign-on (SSO) protocol and open-source software project used for authenticating users in a distributed network environment. CAS allows users to log in once and access multiple services or applications without needing to re-enter their credentials.
