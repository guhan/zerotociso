# Change Management
The structured and systematic approach to planning, implementing, and **managing organizational changes effectively**.

## Key Objectives of Change Management:
- Successful Adoption of Change: Change management aims to ensure that individuals and teams within the organization embrace and adopt the changes being introduced. It seeks to minimize resistance and increase buy-in from employees.
- Minimization of Disruptions: Effective change management helps reduce disruptions to day-to-day operations during periods of change. It **involves planning and coordination to manage potential risks and ensure a smooth transition**.
- Realization of Benefits: Change initiatives are often implemented to achieve specific outcomes or benefits. Change management ensures that these benefits are realized and that the organization is positioned to leverage the changes for improvement.
- Communication and Engagement: **Open and transparent communication is a critical component** of change management. It involves engaging stakeholders, employees, and teams throughout the change process to foster understanding and support.
- Mitigation of Risks: Change management identifies and addresses potential risks associated with the changes being made. It involves risk assessment, contingency planning, and proactive measures to prevent or mitigate issues.

- Document the steps need for a rollback
  - What is required?
  - How long will it take?
  - Any adverse results from a rollback?

### Schedule the change

  - Which is the best time for the people performing the change?
  - Are there any other changes/events taking place?
- Get leadership approval for the change
- Socialize the change, **you can never be loud enough**
  - Inform users _before_ the change so they don't lose productivity
  - Post the change notification on a status page

## Common Approaches and Models in Change Management:
- Kotter's 8-Step Change Model: Developed by John Kotter, this model provides a step-by-step approach to managing change, including creating a sense of urgency, building a guiding coalition, and anchoring change in the organization's culture.
- Lewin's Change Management Model: This model by Kurt Lewin involves three stages: unfreezing (preparing for change), changing (implementing the change), and refreezing (stabilizing the change).
- ADKAR Model: The ADKAR model focuses on individual change and highlights the five elements necessary for successful adoption: awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, and reinforcement.
- Prosci's ADKAR Model: The Prosci ADKAR model is an extension of the ADKAR model, incorporating organizational change management practices and tools.
- Six Sigma DMAIC: The DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) methodology is often used for process improvement projects, which can involve significant change within an organization.
