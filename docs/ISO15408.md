# ISO 15408: Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation
The Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (Common Criteria or CC) is an international standard (ISO/IEC 15408) for evaluating and certifying the security features and capabilities of information technology products and systems. Common Criteria assessments result in a security certification, and these certifications are assigned Evaluation Assurance Levels (EALs) to indicate the depth and rigor of the evaluation.
## Background 
A global effort to merge TSSEC, ITSEC and bring it all up to date. 
More details in ISO 15408 Evaluation Criteria for Information Technology Security

Has three parts
- Intro and General Model
- Security Functional Requirements
- Assurance

## Objectives
- add buyer confidence
- eliminate duplicate evaluationss
- make certification more cost effective
- adhere to high standards
- promote evaluation

## Key Concepts
- **protection profile**: the security desires of the customer
- **security targets**: claims made by the vendor
- **Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL)**: published or marketed levels

## EAL1 - Functionally Tested
This is the lowest level of assurance. It involves a basic examination of the product's design and documentation, along with some functional testing to ensure it meets its security objectives.
## EAL2 - Structurally Tested
At this level, there is an increased focus on the security functions' structure and the product's documentation. Some security testing is performed to verify that security mechanisms are implemented correctly.
## EAL3 - Methodically Tested and Checked
EAL3 includes a more methodical and structured approach to security evaluation. There is a thorough review of the product's design and security features. Extensive testing is performed to validate the security mechanisms.
## EAL4 - Methodically Designed, Tested, and Reviewed
EAL4 represents a higher level of assurance. It involves a detailed examination of the product's design, architecture, and security features. Rigorous testing and vulnerability analysis are conducted to verify that security mechanisms are effective.
## EAL5 - Semiformally Designed and Tested
EAL5 includes a semiformal design and testing approach. The security functions are carefully designed and documented. Extensive testing and vulnerability analysis are conducted, including resistance to penetration attempts.
## EAL6 - Semiformally Verified Design and Tested
EAL6 involves a semiformally verified design, where mathematical models or formal methods are used to verify the product's security properties. Rigorous testing and analysis are also conducted.
## EAL7 - Formally Verified Design and Tested
EAL7 represents the highest level of assurance. It involves a formally verified design, where mathematical or formal methods are used to rigorously prove the security properties of the product. Extensive testing and analysis, including resistance to sophisticated attacks, are conducted.
