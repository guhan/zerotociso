# Container Runtimes
Container runtime environments are software components responsible for running and managing containers. Containers package applications and their dependencies in a consistent and isolated environment, making it easier to deploy and manage applications across different environments. Several container runtimes are available, with Docker being the most well-known.

## Docker
Docker is one of the most popular container runtimes and played a pivotal role in popularizing containerization technology. Docker Engine is the core component responsible for running and managing containers. It provides a command-line interface (CLI) and APIs for container management.
## containerd
Containerd is an industry-standard container runtime that was originally developed by Docker but has since been donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It focuses on core container runtime functionality and serves as a lower-level component that can be used by container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
## rkt (pronounced "rocket")
rkt is a container runtime developed by CoreOS, designed with security and simplicity in mind. It provides features like pod support and strong isolation. While it's not as widely used as Docker, it has gained a following in certain environments.
## cri-o
cri-o is a lightweight, Kubernetes-focused container runtime designed to work seamlessly with Kubernetes. It implements the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI) and is a popular choice for running containers within Kubernetes clusters.
## container-native virtualization (KubeVirt)
KubeVirt extends Kubernetes to manage and run virtual machines (VMs) alongside containers. It allows you to use Kubernetes primitives to manage VMs, offering a unified environment for both containers and VMs.
## gVisor
gVisor is an open-source user-space kernel that provides a container runtime with a strong emphasis on security. It runs containers in a sandboxed environment, reducing the attack surface and enhancing isolation.
## Open Container Initiative (OCI) runtimes
OCI is an open standard for container runtimes and image formats. Many container runtimes, including Docker and containerd, adhere to OCI standards, ensuring compatibility and interoperability.
## Podman
Podman is a container management tool that can serve as an alternative to Docker. It allows users to run and manage containers without requiring a central daemon, making it a suitable choice for scenarios where daemonless operation is preferred.
## frakti
frakti is a container runtime designed to run Kubernetes pods on hypervisors like KVM, making it possible to run pods as VMs within a Kubernetes cluster.
## Wasmtime
While not a traditional container runtime, Wasmtime allows running WebAssembly modules securely, which can be used to isolate and run applications in a lightweight, sandboxed environment.
