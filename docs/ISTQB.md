# International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB)
The International Software Testing Qualifications Board (ISTQB) defines four levels of testing in its testing certification scheme. These levels represent different aspects and stages of the software testing process, from the most detailed and technical to the most comprehensive and business-focused. Here are the four levels of testing as defined by ISTQB:

## Component Testing (also known as Unit Testing):
- At the lowest level, component testing focuses on the testing of individual software components or units, such as functions, methods, or modules.
- The goal is to verify that each component functions correctly in isolation and meets its specifications.
- Component testing is typically performed by developers as part of the development process.
- Common techniques used in component testing include white-box testing and black-box testing.
## Integration Testing:
- Integration testing focuses on the interactions between different components or units when they are integrated into larger modules or systems.
- The goal is to ensure that integrated components work together as expected and that data flows between them correctly.
- Test cases are designed to identify issues related to data exchanges, interface compatibility, and communication between components.
- Common approaches to integration testing include top-down, bottom-up, and incremental testing.
## System Testing:
- System testing is conducted on the entire integrated system or application to evaluate its functionality and performance as a whole.
- It aims to ensure that the system meets the specified requirements and functions correctly in its intended environment.
- Test scenarios cover various aspects, including functional testing, non-functional testing (e.g., performance, security, usability), and regression testing.
- System testing helps identify defects that may have been missed in previous testing levels.
## Acceptance Testing:
- Acceptance testing is the highest level of testing and is focused on determining whether the software satisfies business requirements and is ready for deployment.
- It is typically performed by end-users, customers, or stakeholders to validate that the system meets their expectations.
- Two common types of acceptance testing are User Acceptance Testing (UAT), where end-users validate the system against their needs, and Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT), where the system is validated for operational readiness.
- Successful completion of acceptance testing typically signifies that the software is ready for production use.
